To all the Braves doubters:  Don't worry.  The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around. The pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries to the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well.  Heck, with the five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an injury to one of the five (I hope this doesn't happen, though).  The bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice is catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there's too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer.  Right now, the Cleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300!  But I certainly wouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the Braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting over .300?).  The bullpen... well, it IS suspect.  But when the bats come alive, the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern.  So anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season.  I'm not saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but I'm optim- istic about their season (though it's awful[/INST]

  Someone on the minor league mailing list probably does.    I do, but I don't have time to type the whole thing in (I don't mind looking up specific date ranges or individual games when I can, but there are limits).   Besides, this stuff is EASY to find. Baseball America puts out a book called the Directory. It's $10(US). Has every team's data and schedule in it. If I WERE to type in the whole scheudle, I'd just be spending a lot of time infringing on their copyright.  Folks who are interested in the minors should check out my minor league list (see the signature), and folks who are tracking down team schedules should chec out the BA Directory.

 I hope there is not one- with a subject like this you just have a spiral.  What would then be a morality of a morality of morals.  Labels don't make arguments.  One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be interpreted, even though this would hardly seem moral.  For example ""The best thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough.  Hence all actions must be weighed against this one statement.""  whatever helps this goal is ""moral"", whatever does not is ""immoral""  Of course this leads such a blank space: there are so many different ways to fulfill a goal, one would need a ""hyper-morality"" to apply to just the methods.   Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think about it long enough  :)  On the other hand, maybe it is our first gut reaction...  Which?  Who knows: perhaps here we have a way to discriminate morals.

 I suppose it's too late now, but the repeated use of the word ""release"" is peculiar.  Let's say you and your family are besieged in your home by some people with tanks, helicopters, and automatic weapons.

(Short reply to Kent Sandvik's post remarking how it is strange that somehow Sufism is related to Islam, as [to him] they seem quite different.)  If one really understands Islam, it is not strange that Sufism is associated with it.  In fact, Sufism is (in general) seen as the ""inner dimension"" of Islam.  One of the ""roots"" of the word ""Islam"" is ""submission"" -- ""Islam"" denotes submission to God.  Sufism is the most complete submission to God imaginable, in ""annihilating"" oneself in God.  (I am not a Sufi or on the Sufi path, but have read a lot and recently have been discussing a number of things with others who are on the Sufi path.)[/INST]

 I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue. Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination, grasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme suffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to diminished mental capacity.  At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness. He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years. After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don't say it couldn't happen to you, or that it hasn't happened to others, even if you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this. People are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness in that instance. I would not think[/INST]

I recall a discussion I had heard years ago. It went something like this:  The problem with omnipotence (at least as I perceive it) as personified by  the christian God ideal is that it is potentially contradictory.  If a  manifestation such as God is truly infinite in power can God place limits  upon itself? . . Some stuff I can't recall. Then some other questions I think I recall correctly: Can God unmake itself? Can God make itself (assuming it doesn't yet exist)? Has God has always existed or is it necessary for an observer to bind all of Gods potential quantum states into reality? Was God nothing more than a primordial force of nature that existed during the earliest stages of universal (inflationary?) creation? Is God a vacuum fluctuation? Given a great enough energy density could we re-create God? Would that make US God and God something else? . . Some more stuff I don't recall concerning creating God.  Followed by: Is God self-aware? Is it necessary that God be self-aware? Is God a living entity? Is it necessay that God be a living entity? Is God unchanging or does it evolve? .[/INST]

Empowering Patients First Act of 2015 This bill repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, effective as of their enactment. This bill replaces those provisions with amendments to the Internal Revenue Code, the Public Health Service Act, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to address health care coverage. The bill provides for refundable tax credits for health insurance coverage and health savings account (HSA) contributions. The bill raises the annual HSA contribution limit, expands eligibility for tax-deductible HSA contributions, and allows HSAs to be used to pay periodic or capitated primary care fees. A limit is placed on the amount of an employer's contribution to health coverage that can be excluded from the employee's taxable income. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must provide a grant to each state for high-risk pools or reinsurance pools to subsidize health insurance for high-risk populations and individuals. Funds authorized, tax credits, and tax deductions under this Act may not be used to pay for an abortion or health coverage that includes abortion, with exceptions. This bill provides for the establishment and governance of independent health pools, entities that form risk pools to offer health insurance coverage to their members. Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2015 This bill provides for the establishment and governance of association health plans, which are group health plans sponsored by business associations that meet certain ERISA certification requirements. Health insurers offering individual coverage may deny coverage to an individual, outside of open enrollment periods. Preexisting conditions may be excluded from coverage under certain conditions. Individual health insurance coverage is governed by the laws of a state designated by the health insurance issuer. HHS must issue clinical practice guidelines. The bill specifies how these guidelines may be used in a health care lawsuit. HHS may not use comparative effectiveness research or patient-centered outcomes research to deny coverage of an item or service under a federal health care program. This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to permit Medicare beneficiaries to contract with a physician or practitioner for covered health care and submit a claim for payment under Medicare. Health care professionals are exempted from federal and state antitrust laws in connection with negotiations with a health plan to provide health care items or services.[/INST]

Mark-to-Market Extension Act of 2007 - Amends the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 to reauthorize through FY2011: (1) the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured MultifamilyHousing Mortgage and Housing Assistance Restructuring (Mark-to-Market) program; and (2) the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring. Permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to waive rent level limits for: (1) disaster-damaged eligible projects; and (2) up to 9% (currently 5%) of all units subject to restructured mortgages in any fiscal year, based on certain findings of special need. Redefines multifamily housing project eligible for the Mark-to-Market program to authorize eligibility treatment, upon owner request, for certain projects whose rents do not, on an average per unit or per room basis, exceed the rent of comparable properties in the same market area, if the Secretary determines that such treatment is necessary to preserve a project in the most cost-effective manner in relation to other alternative preservation options. Requires each mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plan to determine, for units assisted with project-based assistance in eligible multifamily housing projects, adjusted rent levels for disaster-damaged eligible projects equal to 100% of the fair market rents for the relevant market area. Revises requirements for an approved mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plan with respect to modification or forgiveness of all or part of a second mortgage held by the Secretary (debt relief) if the project concerned is acquired by a tenant organization or tenant-endorsed community-based nonprofit or public agency. Sets forth requirements for alternative periods of eligibility for such nonprofit debt relief if the purchaser acquires the project subsequent to the date of recordation of the related affordability agreement.[/INST]

 Wow! You got me thinking now!  This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a  move in society to classify previously ""socially unacceptable"" yet legal  activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two  coexisting methods of social control.  First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of  actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set  of punishments.  Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are  the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered  by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if  socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed  since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of  social censure.  The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as ""guilt"" and  ""morality"".  I've heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren't for  the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be  absolutely impossible.

  Wood is fairly small for an enforcer-type. I mean, Fleury does a pretty good job and isn't that large, but Dody is no Fleury.   Having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup, he simply isn't ready to fight at an NHL level (assuming that it's his role, which is ALL he really showed us in his few games up from K.C. -- if he can pass, shoot or skate, I never saw much of it). All he has is a right fist, which isn't bad, but at the NHL level, the other players are smart enough to grab the thing before he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand, he's a fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything he wants to him.

American Job Creation and Investment Promotion Reform Act of 2015 This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend the EB-5 regional center program through September 30, 2020. A regional center shall operate within a defined geographic area, and shall be consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment and creating a significant economic impact within such area. Up to 90% of the employment creation requirements for an EB-5 visa regional center investor (alien investor) may be satisfied through indirect job creation. Job creation credit based on capital investment by non-alien entrepreneurs is limited. Approved regional centers must give advance notice to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of significant proposed changes to their organizational structure, ownership, or administration, which must then be approved by DHS. A commercial enterprise associated with a regional center shall file an application with, and obtain approval from, DHS for each investment offering to aliens seeking alien investor classification, which shall include: (1) a comprehensive business plan, (2) an economic analysis of estimated job creation, and (3) documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For a capital investment in a designated targeted employment area, at least 50% of the estimated job creation shall be expected to occur within a combined statistical area or a metropolitan statistical area, or if the targeted employment area is outside of such an area, in any county that is included in or adjacent to the targeted employment area. DHS shall deny or revoke the approval of a business plan application with any investment or business arrangement that: (1) presents a threat to public safety or national security; or (2) presents a significant risk of criminal misuse, fraud, or abuse. DHS shall establish a process for premium processing of business plan applications. Sanctions are provided for a regional center or affiliated individual that has violated any certification requirement or that is conducting itself in a manner inconsistent with its designation. A regional center shall be terminated from program participation for specified violations. A regional center shall monitor and supervise all offers, purchases, and sales of securities made by associated parties to ensure compliance with U.S. securities laws. The EB-5 Integrity Fund is established in the Treasury. An annual $20,000 fee shall be collected from each regional center. An alien investor shall demonstrate that the required capital and any administrative funds were obtained from a lawful source and through lawful means. If a regional center or regional center associated commercial enterprise has its designation or participation terminated for reasons relating to fraud, intentional material misrepresentation, criminal misuse, or threats to public safety or national security, any person associated with that regional center, including an alien investor, shall be permanently barred from future program participation if the person was a knowing participant in the conduct that led to the termination. An alien entrepreneur who has invested the requisite capital for at least 24 months before admission shall obtain the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence without a conditional basis upon approval of the required petition. If DHS determines that the approval of any petition or the conditional permanent resident status granted to an alien entrepreneur is contrary to the U.S. national interest for reasons of fraud, misrepresentation, criminal misuse, or threats to public safety or national security, DHS shall notify the alien of that determination and deny the petition or terminate the permanent resident status of the alien and family members. The number of fiscal year EB-5 (employment creation) visas is increased for qualified immigrants who invest in a new commercial enterprise which, in addition to creating jobs in a targeted employment area, will invest the required capital in such area. Designation of a non-targeted unemployment area as a targeted employment area shall be valid for renewable two-year periods. The minimum investment amounts are increased for non-targeted employment areas and targeted employment areas. The child of an alien investor whose conditional permanent resident status is terminated shall continue to be considered a child of the alien investor for purposes of a subsequent immigrant petition by the alien investor if the child remains unmarried and the alien investor's subsequent petition is filed within one year after termination of status. Concurrent filing of EB-5 petitions and applications is authorized for status adjustment to conditional lawful permanent resident. An alien petitioning for classification as an alien investor may file a petition with DHS only after approval of an investment in a commercial enterprise. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service shall set fees for services at a level sufficient to ensure the full recovery of the costs of providing those services, including the cost of ensuring that adjudication is completed not later than: 120 days for a regional center, 120 days after receiving an application for approval of investment in a commercial enterprise, 150 days after receiving a petition from an alien desiring to be classified as an alien investor, and 180 days after receiving a petition from an alien for removal of conditional permanent resident status. DHS employees may not give specified preferential treatment to any organization or individual in connection with any aspect of the EB-5 regional center investor visa program.[/INST]

(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on February 3, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.) United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015 (Sec. 2) This bill specifies the findings of Congress that: as of January 22, 2015, the United States has provided over $3 billion in assistance to respond to the Syria humanitarian crisis, of which nearly $467 million has been provided to Jordan; as of January 2015, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there were 621,937 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan, 83.8% of whom lived outside refugee camps; in 2000 the United States and Jordan signed a free-trade agreement that went into force in 2001; in 1996 the United States granted Jordan major non-NATO ally status; and Jordan is suffering from the Syrian refugee crisis and the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). (Sec. 3) U.S. policy should be to: support Jordan in its response to the Syrian refugee crisis, provide necessary assistance to support the basic needs of the assimilated Syrian refugees, cooperate with Jordan to combat the terrorist threat from ISIL or other terrorist organizations, and help secure the border between Jordan and Syria and Iraq. (Sec. 4) It is the sense of Congress that: expeditious consideration of certifications of letters of offer to sell defense articles, defense services, design and construction services, and major defense equipment to Jordan is fully consistent with U. S. security and foreign policy interests and the objectives of world peace and security; and it is in the interest of peace and stability for regional members of the Global Coalition to Combat ISIL to increase their involvement in addressing the ISIL threat. (Sec. 5) The Arms Export Control Act is amended to include Jordan among the countries eligible for certain streamlined defense sales for three years. (Sec. 6) The Department of State is authorized to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Jordan to increase economic support funds and military cooperation, including joint military exercises, personnel exchanges, support for international peacekeeping missions, and enhanced strategic dialogue.[/INST]

 This comes up periodically, and I just don't get it. Take, for example, Mark McGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that's not a potential great example of what you're talking about then I don't know what is. Now let's look at what happens when McGwire doesn't walk:   75% of the time he made an out.   10% of the time he hit a single.   5% of the time he hit a double.   10% of the time he hit a homer. Now, you're pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers, 1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you can get him out 3 times out of 4? Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even though he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in 227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that's right, he's *never* hit a homer in 916 AB's through the end of 1992. Who'd be afraid to throw a strike to him?   Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development |[/INST]

Don was pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn, and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)  Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter and Fuhr.  Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the ""greatest goalie"", and said that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself. He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when Fuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised ""Don't Trade Fuhr!""

During the first three games of the Pens-Devils series, I have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens.  Jagr, MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.  Despite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing adantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens bottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to configure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.  Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed of Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As a result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played almost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern scored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.

    First, a longer game in no way suggests ""more baseball to watch,"" unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball.  The lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches.  And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this is only true when they don't become extra-long.  Quickly-pitched games can grab and hold your attention much better.

  As I don't know this book, I will use your heresay.    It depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them.   Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic way, to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails.    Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge, or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful[/INST]

Much of the dispute about the origin of the fire that destroyed the BD compound could be settled by examining the propane tank supposedly crushed by one of the army tanks when they breached the walls of the compound. If the the propane tank is flattened and has tread marks on it, then the BD's version of the cause of the fire would seem to be verified.  --  Dave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>[/INST]

  Sounds like more of the same.  Gods were used to describe almost everything in the past.  As we come to understand the underpinnings of more and more, the less we credit to a god.  Now, the not-so-well understood elements (at least by the author) includes quarks and tectonic drift.  I guess that's better than describing the perceived patterns of stars in the sky as heroes being immortalized by the gods.  Kinda sounds like old-earth creation--It seems that life did, indeed, evolve from a common ancestor.  What caused that initial common ancestor?  Are we going to hear another debate on causeless events? ;-)  [/INST]

Another article that fell between the cracks:   As evidence for the Resurrection, it is often claimed that the Disciples were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce their claim that Jesus had come back from the dead.  Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happening to Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held belief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any evidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven't found any...  Briefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles. Further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is ""No Martyrs for a Lie"": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting.  Since we don't even know how or where they died, we certainly don't have this information.  (By the way, even in the case of Stephen it is[/INST]

Compete Act of 2007 - Amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to revise requirements for the internal control assessment component of a securities issuer's annual report. Requires the attestation and report by a registered public accounting firm on an issuer's management assessment of its internal control structure and procedures to focus upon the process and system used by management to identify and manage risks, identify and implement key controls, and come to a conclusion on the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting. Prohibits an auditor's attestation and report from including a separate (pass/fail) opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls. Requires such attestation and report to be performed at three-year intervals. Prescribes standards for such attestations and reports, including a risk-based evaluation. Permits attestations and reports to rely on examinations and inspections by federal and state regulatory agencies. Instructs the Securities and Exchange Commission to develop a standard of materiality for such assessments and reports based upon whether the internal control has a material effect on the company's financial statements and is significant to the issuer's overall financial status. Exempts a smaller public company from the requirements for management assessment of internal controls, unless it voluntarily elects to comply with them.[/INST]

This is not a trend. The Caps were done. Goneso in five games, and it saves us Caps fans a lot of pain.  I mean, it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1, watching them  tumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times have they done that in their history?  1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight 1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight 1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight  In other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they  were a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being   1) a sweep of Philly in 1984 2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME  they managed to get out of the division.  Actually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games.

This bill provides directions to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for determining the budgetary effects of energy savings performance contracts and utility energy service contracts. Under an energy savings performance contract, a private party agrees to fund energy-efficient upgrades for a federal facility, and the federal agency agrees to pay the private party from reductions in the agency's energy costs. Under a utility energy service contract, the services and equipment are provided by a utility. In scoring legislation that modifies the authority to enter into the contracts or the scope, terms, or use of the contracts, CBO must: (1) record all budgetary effects during the first year in which the authority or modification becomes effective, (2) calculate the cost and savings on a net present value basis by adding market risk over the useful life of the services or product to the discount rate required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, and (3) classify the effects to be changes in spending subject to the availability of appropriations. CBO currently scores the authority to enter into the contracts as a form of mandatory spending rather than discretionary spending that is subject to the appropriations process.[/INST]

Restoration of Parental Rights and State Sovereignty Act of 2015 Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to prohibit the Secretary of Education from forcing a state to satisfy any requirement imposed as a condition of receiving assistance under an ESEA grant program. Prohibits the Secretary from releasing assistance to a state under an ESEA grant program unless the state's legislature has by law expressly approved the program. Allows that approval to be accomplished by a vote to affirm a state budget that includes the use of such federal funds, but requires that budget to expressly include any requirement imposed as a condition on the state's receipt of those funds. Prohibits ESEA funds that are not allocated to a state due to the state's failure to affirmatively agree to their receipt from being reallocated among the other states.

american and european universities were full of Angry Young People(tm) that wanted to overthrow the government, and wouldn't think twice about lobbing a molotov cocktail at the national guard (military police in Europe.)

I posted about a ""pulse of (relaxation) electricity"".  I now think it more like a pulse of ""relaxation"" or comfort than a pulse of electricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.       Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So, you feel a ""shiver"" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat). Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your body.       ""Shiver"" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake. What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce[/INST]

 While it may mean that in 1993, the relevant meaning comes from 1789. Moreover, ""controlled"" doesn't tell you WHO's doing the controllling.  Fletcher's Political Works, pub'd in 1749, defines a ""well-regulated militia"", that being the relevant phrase, as being an armed people NOT under the control of govt.  The wigged gents who argued about the constituion used it in that way.  Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than ""individual right, not to be interfered with by govt"".  Note that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction on govt military power.  See Scarry's University of Penn law review article for an extended discussion.  The existence of a well-regulated militia is a necessary part of that restriction, but it is not sufficient.  -andy[/INST]

: I heard about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia.  Now, how is it such a grave : mistake to sell Saudi Arabia weapons?  Or are you claiming that we shouldn't : sell any weapons to other countries?  Straightforward answer please.  Saudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering in the politcs of newly renunified Yemen, including assasinations and  border incursions. It is entirely possible that they will soon invade. Unluckily for Yemen it is not popular in the West as they managed to put aside political differences during reunification and thus the West has effectively lost one half (North?) as a client state.[/INST]

Stuff deleted  I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an. In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished.  Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.  However, when an apostate makes attacks upon ""God and His Messenger"" the situation changes. Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps  charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation changes. The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.  There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc.  against the[/INST]

 Hey American Hockey fans,  As a hockey fan I can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel.  The problem is that other Americans don't give a shit about hockey.  They view it as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in two-thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally.  On the other hand BASEBALL is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* ""NATIONAL PASTTIME"".  BASEBALL is so romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport exist after April 1 and before November 1.  I feel that since ESPN shows 5+ BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game.  Hell, the game is going to last 2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs?  And I am an Indians fan!  Show the end of what you started, then switch!  But then, I'm a hockey fan, what do I know?  BASEBALL is the all mighty sport.[/INST]

[...]  You could be right.  Then again, you could be wrong.  This claim is completely unverifiable and untestable.  I'd wager most of the Braves fans on the net could name more than 3 players from their 1988 season.  You could give away tickets to Braves games.  However, my Dad and I were able to get great seats from scalper for face value, which isn't exactly the sign of a hot ticket...   This is *precisely* why they were considered America's team.  Even (especially?) when they were bad, you could see most of the Braves games on cable.  You could do that for the Cubs as well, but the Braves had better camerawork, better announcers (what would you rather listen to -- Harry discuss the game, or Skip and Pete discuss motoball?), and teams that weren't *too* much worse.  Because of TBS, the Braves had a lot of fans outside of Georgia. At home in Kentucky, even though we were much closer to Cincinnati there was as many Braves fans as Reds fans, even in 1990.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) establish a process for accrediting air ambulances according to three specified levels of accreditation, from lowest to highest; (2) consider certain factors in designating accreditation organizations; (3) establish criteria for use by an accreditation organization to evaluate an air ambulance; and (4) establish certain requirements for the collection of related data. Prohibits reimbursement for air ambulance services under a state plan under SSA title XVII (Medicaid) unless the state develops licensing and regulatory requirements for such services that comply with federal guidelines.

 As I understand, that number is deceptive.  The reason is that the money cost was in non-oil sales for the most part.  Iraq still is not allowed to sell oil, or do many of the things under the initial sanctions, but is still surviving.   Of the ~93% (I have heard figures closer to 80%, but I won't quibble your figures), most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by enemy troops.  A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them around the clock.  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb munitions.    2.  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse.

Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to revise the objectives of the civilian nuclear energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs of the Department of Energy (DOE) to emphasize: providing research infrastructure to promote scientific progress and enable users from academia, the National Laboratories, and the private sector to make scientific discoveries relevant for nuclear, chemical, and materials science engineering; and enabling the private sector to partner with the National Laboratories to demonstrate novel reactor concepts for the purpose of resolving technical uncertainty associated with the aforementioned objectives. The bill expresses the sense of Congress regarding nuclear energy, urging DOE to focus its civilian nuclear research and development activities towards programs that enable the private sector, National Laboratories, and universities to carry out experiments necessary to promote scientific progress and enhance practical knowledge of nuclear engineering. (Sec. 3) The bill repeals the Nuclear Power 2010 Program, and makes technical corrections removing the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology as the designated entity to conduct the research, development, and demonstration programs on advanced fuel recycling technology and cost-effective technologies for increasing the safety and security of nuclear facilities. (The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology was replaced in DOE by the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science, and the Office of Technology Transitions.) (Sec. 6) The bill repeals requirements for development of a comprehensive plan for the operation and maintenance of its facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory to support civilian nuclear energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs, including radiological facilities management, isotope production, and facilities management. By December 31, 2016, DOE shall instead determine the mission need for a versatile reactor-based fast neutron source, which shall operate as a national user facility and, if such a need is determined, give Congress a plan to establish the facility. DOE shall ensure that the user facility will provide at a minimum: fast neutron spectrum irradiation capability, and capacity for upgrades to accommodate new or expanded research needs. The DOE shall leverage from the Office of Science the best practices for management, construction, and operation of national user facilities. (Sec. 8) The bill repeals the requirement that by August 1, 2006, DOE submit to Congress the results of a survey of alternatives to industrial applications of large radioactive sources. DOE shall instead carry out a program to enhance the nation's capabilities to develop new reactor technologies through high-performance computing modeling and simulation techniques. Such program shall coordinate with relevant federal agencies through the National Strategic Computing Initiative while taking into account specified objectives. (Sec. 9) DOE shall also carry out a program to enable the testing and demonstration of reactor concepts to be proposed and funded by the private sector. DOE shall leverage the technical expertise of relevant federal agencies and national laboratories in order to minimize the time required to enable construction and operation of privately funded experimental reactors at national laboratories or other DOE-owned sites while ensuring safety for persons working within those sites. Such reactors shall operate to enable physical validation of novel reactor concepts and generate research and development to improve nascent technologies. DOE shall assess its capabilities to authorize, host, and oversee privately funded fusion and advanced fission experimental reactors. (Sec. 10) Within 12 months of this bill's enactment, DOE must submit to Congress two alternative 10-year budget plans for civilian nuclear energy research and development by the DOE, one assuming constant annual funding for 10 years at the appropriated FY2016 level, and the other an unconstrained budget. DOE must also identify to Congress: engineering designs for innovative fusion energy systems with the potential to demonstrate net energy production within 15 years of the start of construction, and budgetary requirements necessary for DOE to carry out a fusion innovation initiative to accelerate research and development of those designs.[/INST]

   No firearms were ever ever shot at the National Guard at Kent State.  At the time of the shooting, no rocks were being thrown at all.  The squad was slowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some students were taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two students who were following and taunting.  The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while occasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from. All at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1 Garands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this 45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with the taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in the confrontation.  There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently they had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had conveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.

Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers Reform and Improvement Act of 2016 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to codify the establishment of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The FLETC must be headed by a director who reports to the DHS Secretary. The bill sets forth functions of the director, including to: establish and execute organizational plans and priorities; direct and manage training facilities, programs, and activities; develop training goals and curricula; disseminate homeland security information to law enforcement and security agencies and private sector stakeholders; conduct acquisition in compliance with federal law and regulations; coordinate and share digital resources with federal agencies; and collaborate to improve international instructional development, training, and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement. Additionally, the bill sets forth training responsibilities of the FLETC and partner organizations (i.e., federal agencies that participate in FLETC training programs under a formal memorandum of understanding). It authorizes the FLETC to: (1) train federal employees engaged in homeland security operations or law enforcement activities, and (2) execute strategic partnerships with state and local law enforcement agencies and coordinate with private sector stakeholders to provide training. The FLETC must consult with relevant law enforcement and security agencies to develop and deliver training programs. A partner organization must pay for and assign non-reimbursable detailed instructors to support training programs. The FLETC may conduct federal employee trainings at FLETC facilities, at off-site locations, or by distributed learning (e.g., online); detail its employees throughout DHS; charge fees for non-federal trainings; provide certain student support services; hire retired federal employees with training experience; and reimburse travel expenses of non-federal and intermittent federal employees. Individuals who attend FLETC training must reside in FLETC housing, to the extent practicable. Finally, the bill codifies existing authorities of the FLETC to spend funds to promote awareness of and support for law enforcement training, accept and use gifts for authorized purposes, accept reimbursement for the construction or renovation of training facilities, obligate funds in anticipation of reimbursements, purchase uniforms and passenger vehicles, and provide room and board for student interns. It also authorizes the FLETC to spend funds to honor and memorialize FLETC graduates who have died in the line of duty.[/INST]

 No doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers.  I'm rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature in the accepted academic/scientific journals.  So, the righteous among them will no doubt jump on that.

Then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even though he, like Linus Pauling, is lucid and robust well into his nineties--but nevermind about that.

 One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical  literature to keep up with changes in medical practice.  All the clamor  over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical  trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against  cancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective,  treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals  are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to  use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due  to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden  Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize  the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use  and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to  restore competetion for candida in the body.

   I don't buy this at all.  I think things are colored to a very large degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are.  Try this exercise:  XXX is pitching today.  His team scores 4 in the first inning, and 3 in the fourth.  XXX gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th.  In the fifth, he gives up 3 runs.  In the 6th, he gives up 2 more.  The score is now 7-5, with XXX's team still on top.  I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be ""he is a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win.""  If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be ""he is an inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch.  Needs more seasoning.  Send him to AAA.  Or to the spice rack.""  [/INST]

 [...stuff deleted...]  As many posters have said in as many posts lately, this is just not true.  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the  _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render  that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to  think about.  It's not either or.  Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind.    I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily applied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming reason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put  his faith and dogma there.  Not so with the christian religion. [/INST]

 This is ridiculous, and your doctor sounds like a nut, if what is reported here is what the doctor actually said.  If your wife's pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic, she'll need insulin replacement.  That doesn't mean she's ""dependent"" on insulin, anymore than she was beforehand--if her body doesn't make enough, she'll have to get it elsewhere.  Oral thyroid replacement hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism, and it's really the only effective therapy available anyway.  Plus, it's cheap.  Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone, but that's a _feature_, not a _bug_, and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of hypothyroidism, because her problem that her gland isn't producing enough.  There isn't a clinical phenomenon of ""thyroid insufficiency"" caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of prolonged administration of corticosteroids, so there should be no worry about inappropriately ""suppressing"" the thyroid gland.

 Some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist... but faith in what?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn does not exist?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that Santa Claus does not exist?  If it does (and it may for some people I suppose) it certainly isn't as big a leap of faith to say that these things (and god) DO exist.  (I suppose it depends on your notion and definition of ""faith"".)  Besides... not believing in a god means one doesn't have to deal with all of the extra baggage that comes with it!  This leaves a person feeling wonderfully free, especially after beaten over the head with it for years! I agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer for many people and for that reason I think it's important.

Please note that especially in the field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.       That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is, there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.   Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.     And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.       That's bogus. Self reference is not circular.

Safe Routes to School Program Reauthorization Act - Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to reauthorize appropriations for FY2012-FY2016 for the safe routes to school program. Revises program requirements to specify children kindergarten through 12th grade as the ones to be benefited by the program. Revises criteria used to determine state apportionment of program funds. Includes projects for other nonmotorized modes of transportation besides walking and bicycling as noninfrastructure-related projects. Authorizes states to set-aside up to 10% of apportioned funds for infrastructure improvements that create safe routes to bus stops located outside of the vicinity of schools. Requires each state that receives an apportionment to carry out an assessment of the economic and geographical distribution of funding to ensure that low-income schools are adequately able to access such funds. Defines ""low-income school"" to mean a school in which 65% or more of students qualify for a free or reduced price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.

Unfortonately, that truly is about the best summation of the research that there is.  Advantages stated of circumcison included probably prevention of penile cancer, (which, interestingly, occurs mostly in men whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor), simplicity of personal hygiene, prevention of urinary tract infections, and prevention of a unretractible foreskin,  Disadvantages include infection from the  procedure, pain, etc.  I apologize; I am trying to pull this off the top of my head.  I will post what I discovered in research; I did a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school. It really is a decision that is up to the parents.  Some parents use the reasoning that they will ""look like Daddy"" and like their friends as justification.  There is nothing wrong with this; just be sure it is what you want to do, since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise a male, although a major surgical procedure exists.

 I would argue Gerald, that Bowman is the first ""modern"" coach. Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-room in the 70s.  He is the first coach I have seen, that manipulates the press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (During important games listen to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that to what is on the ice!)  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups.  Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free  in OT.  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was trademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach!

I have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings.  Some say the lead/ mercury leeches into your system and this is bad.  And I have recently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breeding ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.     My dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where I have two cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both. He says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large. So, I would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam and composite.

Strengthening American Transportation Security Act of 2016 This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the personnel system used by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provides insufficient workplace protections for its workforce and such personnel should be entitled to protections under the civil service system applicable to all federal employees. The bill repeals personnel authorities of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Transportation governing the conditions of employment for TSA employees, thus making TSA employees subject to the personnel management system applicable to all other federal employees. Within 60 days after the enactment of this bill or an earlier date set by DHS: (1) all TSA personnel management policies, directives, letters, and guidelines and any DHS human resources management system shall cease to be effective with respect to TSA employees; and (2) TSA employees shall become subject to labor provisions applicable to other federal transportation employees.

DHS shall consult with the labor organization certified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority to carry out the conversion of TSA employees and positions to the civil service system.

Alaska Hero's Card Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a two-year pilot program assessing the feasibility and advisability of carrying out a program by which certain veterans entitled to VA services residing in communities in the state of Alaska that are inaccessible by motor vehicle can, subject to exceptions, receive necessary hospital care or medical services at any hospital or medical facility or from any medical provider eligible to receive payments under: (1) titles XVIII (Medicare) or XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, (2) the TRICARE program (a Department of Defense [DOD] managed health care program), or (3) the Indian health program. Requires the cost of any hospital care or medical service provided under the pilot program to be borne by the United States from amounts other than amounts appropriated or otherwise made available for an Indian health program. Directs the Secretary to take measures ensuring that covered veterans are not billed for hospital care and medical services received under the pilot program. Requires the Secretary, in carrying out the pilot program, to issue to each covered veteran a card to be known as an ""Alaska Hero Card"" that such veteran may present to an authorized provider to establish the covered veteran's eligibility for hospital care and medical services under the pilot program. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a list of authorized providers from whom a covered veteran may receive hospital care and medical services under the pilot program.[/INST]

Drone Aircraft Privacy and Transparency Act of 2013 - Amends the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 to direct the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to study and identify any potential threats to privacy protections posed by the integration of unmanned aircraft (drone) systems into the national airspace system, including any potential violations of privacy principles. Directs the Secretary to establish certain procedures to allow for civil operation in the national airspace system of small drone systems that do not meet expedited operational authorization requirements. Requires such procedures to ensure that the integration of drone systems into the national airspace system is done in compliance with privacy principles. Prohibits the Secretary from approving, issuing, or awarding any certificate, license, or other grant of authority to operate a drone system in the national airspace system unless the application for it includes a data collection statement, meeting certain requirements, that provides reasonable assurance that the applicant will operate the drone system in accordance with privacy principles. Applies the same privacy principles requirement to any drone system to be operated by a law enforcement agency or a law enforcement agency contractor or subcontractor, except that the application for it shall include a data minimization statement, meeting certain requirements, instead of a data collection statement. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to make any approved certificate, license, or other grant of authority, plus other specified information, available in a searchable format on the public FAA website. Prohibits any person or entity from using a drone system, or requesting information or data collected by another entity through use of a drone system, for protective activities, or for law enforcement or intelligence purposes, except pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (or, in the case of a state court, issued using state warrant procedures) by a court of competent jurisdiction, or as otherwise provided in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Makes an exception to this prohibition in exigent circumstances when a law enforcement entity reasonably believes there is: (1) an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury; or (2) a high risk of a terrorist attack by a specific individual or organization, according to the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS). Makes it unlawful to operate a drone system in a manner that is not in accordance with the terms of a data collection statement or in a manner violating any portion of the final rule for the procedures for civil operation of small drone systems required by this Act. Grants enforcement authority to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Authorizes a state to bring a civil action on behalf of state residents in state or U.S. district court for injunctive relief against violations of this Act or related regulations if the state attorney general has reason to believe that an interest of state residents has been or is threatened or adversely affected by a prohibited act or practice. Creates a private right of action in state or U.S. district court for persons injured by a prohibited act. Allows a suit against a governmental entity. Requires the FAA to revoke the certificate, license, or other grant of authority to operate a drone system operated in a prohibited manner. Declares that nothing in this Act may be construed to apply to model aircraft flown strictly for hobby or recreational purposes and meeting certain other criteria.[/INST]

 You're definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched in between Clark and Bonds.  He must, and I mean MUST, get fastballs to hit...otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise. What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds, Williams, and Clark 3-4-5, the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing abilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners. I think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the 3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having  Clark in the 5 spot.[/INST]

  Drop three billiard balls on a ramp, and they all roll in the same direction.  Pour some blood into the sea, and sharks will converge from miles around.  Throw a pebble at one starling, and all 200 will depart.  Natural processes can mimic the outward results of conspiracy when no actual conspiracy is required.  Put a government functionary in an embarrassing situation, and he quickly covers his ass.  This, too, is completely natural.   It looks that way to me, too.  But you have to understand that it's NOT  the first time they have instigated raids like these.  The most recent one ALSO ended up in a long standoff, but it wasn't quite as public as this one, and they didn't kill quite as many people.  Maybe this  screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more  residences in this manner.  But probably not.   I assume you're talking about Philadelphia.

   -Allergy medicine, huh?  Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or whatever, or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like an antihistamine does?)  As far as doctors over here are concerned, if you slip up and eat something you're allergic to (even if they won't test you to tell you what to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms, then fine, otherwise you just suffer.  One doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs the NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwing up for four solid days and couldn't even drink water - but I got taken off it again when I moved and had to change doctors.  Reasoning: they did not know what the side-effects were because it was new.  OK, fine - but it has passed the safety tests to get on the prescription list, and anyway I was prepared to take the risk to have quality of life now.

I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes (type II, I guess--no insulin).    I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known.  Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the weight gain.   For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off.  Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much interest, like bread on the waters.   With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.  Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a balanced diet.

I understand about contracts, but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games! Anyway,  us BLUES (and Hawks) fans got shafted worse!  While everyone in the U.S. and watched the game on ABC.  However those of us who live in the central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus(?) Telethon.  The area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through HAWK VISION.  This game, had it been televised, would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the area since 1980.  This television BULL*&%$ has got to stop.

        Well, again, I am doing as much as the poster I was replying too. I am quite busy and really don't have the time to respond in full scholarly form to every accusation that is flippantly made by someone who's  being clearly antagonistic.     I have considered it. But if someone spreads falsehoods out of ignorance then they are still spreading falsehoods. Those falsehoods generally do not come out of nowhere but are produced by people who know that what they are saying is (at _least_) not the whole truth. I still consider such spreading of falsehoods propaganda on some level.     Bob, I never accused you of having your head up your ass! It takes me quite some time in dealing with someone before accusing them of having their head up their ass. I was accusing the original poster (Benedikt, I believe) of being so impaired.

Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2015 Establishes a criminal offense for concealment of a security breach of computerized data containing sensitive personally identifiable information that results in economic harm of $1,000 or more to any individual. Authorizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) to commence a civil action to enjoin unauthorized persons or entities from accessing or transmitting computer commands commonly referred to as botnets that would impair the integrity or availability of 100 or more computers used by financial institutions or the federal government or that affect interstate or foreign commerce or communications during any one-year period, including by denying access to the computers, installing unwanted software, or obtaining information without authorization. Allows DOJ to enjoin the alienation or disposal of, or to seek restraining orders prohibiting the disposal of, property obtained as a result of such a violation. Expands categories of money laundering offenses to include financial transactions involving the proceeds of unlawful manufacturing, distribution, possession, and advertising of wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepting devices. Requires certain business entities that collect, use, access, transmit, store, or dispose of sensitive personally identifiable information in electronic or digital form of 10,000 or more U.S. persons during any 12-month period to implement a consumer privacy and data security program that complies with safeguards identified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Requires entities, following discovery of a security breach, to notify U.S. residents whose unencrypted personal information is reasonably believed to have been accessed or acquired. Sets forth special notification procedures for: (1) third party entities that maintain or process data in electronic form on behalf of another entity; and (2) certain providers of electronic data transmission, routing, storage, or network connection services. Directs entities to notify a federal entity designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) if a security breach involves: (1) the personal information of more than 5,000 individuals, (2) databases containing the personal information of more than 500,000 individuals nationwide, (3) federal databases, or (4) federal employees and contractors involved in national security or law enforcement. Requires the DHS-designated entity to provide the information it receives to: (1) the U.S. Secret Service or the Federal Bureau of Investigation for law enforcement purposes; and (2) other federal agencies for law enforcement, national security, or data security purposes. Establishes a process for DOJ to adjust the thresholds for law enforcement and national security notifications. Requires notice of certain breaches to be provided to consumer reporting agencies and the FTC. Exempts certain financial institutions, entities that comply with health record privacy laws, and electronic communication service providers from certain requirements of this Act. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act and provides enforcement authority to the FTC, DOJ, and states. Supersedes federal and state laws that are less stringent than the data security practices and breach notification standards required by this Act, but permits states to continue to enforce other consumer protection laws and to apply state laws regarding trespasses, contracts, torts, or fraud.[/INST]

=>Greg:Flame definitely intended here.  Bill was making fun of the misspelling.  =>Go look up the word ""krill.""  Also, the correct spelling is Kirlian.  It =>involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the =>subject to a high-voltage source, not of some ""aura.""  It works equally well =>with inanimate objects. = =True.. but what about showing the missing part of a leaf?  Is this =""corona discharge""?  Yup.  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between the plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it.  You then cut off part of the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  You see pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn't nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between photographs.  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place conducts electricity.

American Innovation Act This bill amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to require certain adjustments to discretionary spending limits in FY2016-FY2021 to accommodate increases in appropriations for agencies that perform basic science research. Adjustments are required for the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy Office of Science, Department of Defense science and technology programs, National Institute of Standards and Technology Scientific and Technical Research and Services, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate. The bill also requires annual appropriations for each of the programs and agencies referenced in this bill to be at least the amount appropriated in FY2015. The bill exempts appropriations provided pursuant to this bill from sequestration. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.[/INST]

     Wiggins, Alan?  But that's besides the point.  I'm sure people would feel slightly sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed.  But, they would also be criticizing him a lot more for his actions.  Example?    How about Jose Canseco?  He gets a couple of speeding tickets, and all of the sudden his attitude is awful.  What the hell do speeding tickets have to do with clubhouse influence anyway?  So why do sportswriters talk about it all the time.  Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell?  Both of whom had DWI problems towards the end of last year.  (Two years ago?)  It was cited as a sign of their immaturity, etc.    Meanwhile, Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton, and I didn't read any sportswriter complaining about that.  They may have talked about how bad it was for the Phillies, but I NEVER read anywhere criticism of Dykstra's character (or Daulton's intelligence, for that matter) based on this incident. [/INST]

 Minor point:  Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but not with the Jets in mind as the tennant.  The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea. When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using the new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing with the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.   I'm under the impression that when Murph says it, he means it!  As a regular goer to Shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and renovated the place.  Remember, this is its 30th Year![/INST]

Business Incubator Promotion Act - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act to include among the Act's goals encouraging distressed communities to support the formation of business incubators to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in economically distressed areas. Defines ""business incubator"" as an entity established to foster the startup of businesses or accelerate the growth of fledgling companies by providing entrepreneurs with resources and services to produce viable businesses that can help create jobs and restore vitality to distressed areas, excluding an entity organized primarily as for-profit venture. Modifies criteria for the eligibility of an area for grants under such Act for public works and economic development or economic adjustment projects to require an area to have had an unemployment rate of at least 1% greater than the national average for the most recent 12-month (currently, 24-month) period for which data are available. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) increase the federal share for public works and economic development project grants based upon an area's unemployment rate or per capita income compared to the national average; and (2) reduce or waive the non-federal or local share required for participation in such grant assistance for a special need area in cases of severe economic distress. Authorizes the Secretary to provide competitive grants for: (1) the development and implementation of feasibility studies and plans for the creation or expansion of business incubators; and (2) the temporary support of operations of business incubators that is essential to self-sustainability.[/INST]

 Don't expect to get top quality, just some toughness.  I don't  view Makarov as a player who would add toughness.    Nelson, you're confusing skill and toughness.    Hey, get off the McGill/Hammond thing.  I'm no fan of either. My  point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing  this year.  This year we had more skill, I'm all for that, but  if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they  can't do you much good.  Whether it's a cheap shot or not you  can't let the other teams push you around.  The 1992-93 Sharks  simply got pushed around to much.  Other teams knew this.  They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not  pay for it.   Adding some players in the off season who will  add some toughness to the team will help insure that next  season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously   check our skill players, or to take cheap shots.

Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2011 - Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to require the program of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology research, development, demonstration, and commercial application to: (1) apply advanced systems engineering and system integration methods to identify critical interfaces and develop open standards for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy; (2) transfer the resulting environmental data to industry stakeholders as public information through published interface definitions, standards, and demonstration projects; and (3) develop incentives for industry to comply with such standards. Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to award competitive grants to support modifying or constructing four or more geographically dispersed marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology research, development, and demonstration test facilities for the demonstration of multiple technologies in actual operating environments. Requires the Secretary to give preference to existing facilities and National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers. Renames such Centers as the ""National Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers"" and expands their research and clearinghouse duties to include hydrokinetic as well as marine renewable energy research. Authorizes such Centers to serve as technology test facilities. Requires the Secretary to establish a marine-based energy device verification program to provide a bridge from the marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy capture device design and development efforts underway across the industry to commercial deployment of such devices. Requires the Secretary to establish a grant program to: (1) advance the development of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy; (2) help fund the costs of environmental analysis affecting the deployment of marine hydrokinetic devices; (3) help eligible entities to collect the types of environmental data that are required when working in a public resource, monitor the impacts of demonstration projects, and make the resulting information available for dissemination to aid future projects; and (4) help fund the cost of advancing renewable marine and hydrokinetic technologies in ocean and riverine environments from demonstration projects to development and deployment.

Health Insurance Rate Review Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to declare that federal requirements that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) review unreasonable premium increases in health care coverage shall not be construed to prohibit a state from imposing additional rate requirements on health insurance issuers that are more protective of consumers. Expands such review to include all rate increases, not only premium increases. Directs the Secretary or the relevant state insurance commissioner (or state regulator) to take corrective actions to ensure that any excessive, unjustified, or unfairly discriminatory rates are corrected before, or as soon as possible after, implementation, including through mechanisms such as denying rates, modifying rates, or requiring rebates to consumers. Authorizes civil monetary penalties and ineligibility as a qualified health plan for failing to comply with any corrective action taken by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to determine whether the state insurance commissioner or regulator or the Secretary will undertake such corrective actions based on whether the state can adequately undertake such actions.

  I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is engaged on a project to ""convert"" the souls of deceased persons of other religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into heaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and the story was quite detailed).[/INST]

Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act Improvements Act of 2010 - Amends the federal criminal code to include a law enforcement officer of the Amtrak Police Department and the Federal Reserve or a law enforcement or police officer of the executive branch as a qualified law enforcement officer eligible to carry concealed firearms. Expands the definition of ""firearm"" to include ammunition not expressly prohibited by federal law or subject to the provisions of the National Firearms Act. Revises the definition of ""qualified retired law enforcement officer"" to: (1) include officers separated (currently, retired) in good standing from service with a public agency as a law enforcement officer; and (2) reduce the years-of-service requirement for such officers from 15 to 10 years. Revises: (1) requirements for firearms certification for such separated officers to allow firearms training in accordance with the standards of the officer's former agency, the state in which such officer resides, or if such state has not established training standards, standards established by a law enforcement agency within the state or those used by a certified firearms instructor; and (2) mental health requirements for such officers.[/INST]

Protecting States' Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act - Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from enforcing any federal regulation, guidance, or permit requirement regarding hydraulic fracturing (including any component of that process), relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on or under any land in any state that has regulations, guidance, or permit requirements for that activity. Requires the Secretary to recognize and defer to state regulations, permitting, and guidance, for all activities regarding hydraulic fracturing relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on federal land regardless of whether those rules are duplicative, more or less restrictive, have different requirements, or do not meet federal regulations, guidance, or permit requirements.

so. done, career   Velarde hasn't been to Columbus, if I recall, for about three years.  Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat. He might be demoralized about not playing full time, but he hasn't been shuttled around.  I think he's been in New York ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I believe.   I don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot it around either.  I think if Velarde is given a chance, he could become extremely productive.

Daigle has shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked, and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a rock.   Also remember that a lot of teh ""draft 1st"" stuff comes from the assumption he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects.

Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a  review of the research notes of the ""cold fusion scientists"" actually  proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.

Disclaimer -- This is for fun.  In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called ""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would not make with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Juan Gonzalez would not have made.""  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra  Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this[/INST]

-*----  I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms. (To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of hidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and the proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)  On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by suggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  The doubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.)  I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or another.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the one who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honest route, and so I am happy with it.[/INST]

 It wasn't ""invented"", but was supposed by the writers of the Constitution to be a universal, pre-existing right. Howsomever...   Hmmm.  You need to spend some time in a library, son.  When the Bill of Rights was written, in addition to the (muzzleloading) shotgun and pistol you mention we had:   - rifles in calibers ranging from around .30 to .69 caliber and up.  - cannon with various different projectiles to choose from (and owned    by civilians).  - breech-loading rifles  In addition, semiautomatic and full-automatic firearms had been patented and/or demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding century or so.   Sounds good.  Any refererences to this actually happening, or is it just exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone firing a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an Uzi, semi- or full-auto?   Until the root conditions that justified it go away (criminal behavior, either private or government, which should be defended against), there's no reason it should go away.  -- [/INST]

Forewarn Act - Amends the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the Act) to: (1) redefine the terms ""employer,"" ""plant closing,"" and ""mass layoff"" for purposes of the Act; and (2) among other things, apply it to employers of 75 or more employees (currently, 100 employees), including any parent company of which the business enterprise is a subsidiary. Requires an employer to: (1) give 90-day written notice (currently, 60-day) to employees and appropriate state and local governments before ordering a plant closing or mass layoff; (2) notify the Secretary of Labor and the governor of the state in which the closing or layoff will occur; and (3) provide affected employees with information regarding benefits and services available to them, including unemployment compensation, trade adjustment assistance, COBRA benefits, onsite access to rapid response teams, and certain other services. Exempts from such notice requirements plant closings or mass layoffs which are due directly to a terrorist attack. Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate U.S. Senators and Members of the House of Representatives who represent the area where such closing or mass layoff is to occur. Makes an employer who violates such notice requirements liable to the employee for, among other things, two days pay (currently, back pay for each day of violation) multiplied by the number of calendar days for which the employer was required but failed to provide notice, including interest on such pay. Authorizes an affected employee to file a complaint with the Secretary alleging a violation of the notice requirements. Requires the Secretary to investigate and attempt to resolve such complaints. Authorizes the Secretary to bring an action in court to recover on behalf of an affected employee any backpay (including interest), benefits, and liquidated damages due. Requires an employer to post conspicuously upon its premises pertinent provisions of this Act and information on the filing of a complaint. Requires the Secretary to maintain a guide on the benefits and services available to affected employees. Prohibits the waiver of rights and remedies provided under this Act (including the right to maintain a civil action) by any agreement or settlement negotiated on behalf of affected employees.[/INST]

Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have  wondered, ""If it wasn't suicide, why did so few get out?""  The  answer is now available - the gas the government had been pouring in on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by the chemical weapons treaty.

 What is ""doing it right the first time""?  Murdered them all?  Used tanks?  Maybe they should have had enough evidence to indict.  From the list presented to date, I haven't seen ANYTHING illegal.  They claim that the BD's bought components to convert their weapons to Class III devices, but no evidence that they had done so.  In fact, with a Class III FFL living with them, this may have been legal (given recent court rulings).  What you really meant to say was that the ATF should have done the right and lwaful thing.

Hi.  My wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness to gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?) tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are not very interested in starting medication as this ""deactivates"" the  gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of  monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the  'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language, but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the  brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)   My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach? Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this affect the treatment, development?

Refugee Resettlement Oversight and Security Act of 2015 This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the President, after appropriate consultation with certain congressional committees, to recommend to Congress the number of refugees who may be admitted into the United States in a fiscal year. Except in the case of an unforeseen emergency refugee situation, no refugees may be admitted in a fiscal year until Congress enacts a joint resolution setting the number of refugees who may be admitted in that fiscal year. In determining an alien's admissibility on security and related grounds the Department of Homeland Security shall consult with the Director of National Intelligence and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Beginning in FY2016 and ending in FY2020, the President, when considering the admission of refugees who are nationals or citizens of Iraq or Syria, shall give priority to members of a persecuted religious minority. The Government Accountability Office shall report to Congress on the effectiveness of the refugee screening process in protecting U.S. security.[/INST]

 And not the only quality Mariner pitcher.  I logged on expecting to see at least ONE congratulatory note for Chris Bosio's NO HITTER, but nary a peep.    So I'll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now 11-5 and slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games or even a hit in last night's gem.    Not that we M's fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers of New England's long-running tragedy, but only one winning season in history is something of a burden to bear.

Well, we're almost halfway through the first round, and so far things are good in general:    1. The 2 teams that I hate most: Chicago and ""Basten"" are down 3 zip.      (even though there is a possibility either can still win their       series, yet this ego-thrashing and arrogance-smashing by the       underdogs (St. Louis and Buffalo) is so rewarding).   2. Montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good      enough to go all the way, yet too good to be able to get some      (really) good draft picks... :-(   3.

Stop Tampering of Prescription Pills Act of 2012 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prescribe new drug application requirements for tamper-resistant drugs: (1) containing as an active moiety (the part of the drug that makes it work the way it does) a controlled substance classified as opium, an opiate, or a derivative; (2) formulated for oral administration; (3) exhibiting physicochemical properties making them significantly more difficult or ineffective in altering the drug's characteristics for purposes of misuse or abuse; and (4) containing one or more additional ingredients intended to deter abuse through potential pharmacological effects. Requires the Secretary to refuse a new drug application for any new (brand name) drug containing opium, an opiate, or a derivative as an active moiety that is not tamper-resistant if a tamper-resistant drug containing the same active moiety has been approved and has not been discontinued from marketing. Authorizes the Secretary to approve an application failing to meet such requirements, however, if approval is necessary to prevent or alleviate a drug shortage or otherwise address a significant unmet public health need. Requires an abbreviated new (generic) drug application for a tamper-resistant drug to include testing information demonstrating that the generic drug resists manipulation or the effect of manipulation to a degree at least comparable to the listed drug. Authorizes the Secretary to deny approval of a generic application if the listed drug is tamper-resistant and one or more of the generic drug's active moieties differ in any material respect from those of the listed drug. Declares that an approved generic drug shall not be considered bioequivalent to, or as having the same therapeutic effect as, a listed drug if the listed drug becomes tamper-resistant unless and until the generic drug demonstrates that it resists manipulation or the effect of manipulation to a degree at least comparable to the listed drug. Prescribes requirements governing when a drug which is not tamper-resistant may have its approval withdrawn or suspended.[/INST]

 [...deletions...]   An ""Islamic Bank"" is something which operates in a different fashion to your modern bank, as I have explained here (on another thread) before. For example, Islamic banks don't pay fixed interests on deposits, but a return on investments (which varies according to the market, and is not fixed like interest is).  Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world. There are no Islamic banks in ""the West"", including the USA, to my knowledge.  I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not while ""Islamic banks"" are at a relatively early stage of their development as is the case now.  BCCI is most certainly not an ""Islamic bank"" -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  If the answer to this question is ""yes"", then BCCI was not an Islamic bank, as Islamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.  Whether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely irrelevant.  [/INST]

 The bacteria in your gut are important.  But colonic flushes are not the  way to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of  bacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of  antibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in  your gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real  problem in some of the outfits that do this ""treatment"" since the equipment  is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient ""treatments"".

Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2008 or the PACT Act - Amends the Jenkins Act to revise provisions governing the collection of taxes on, and trafficking in, cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. (Sec. 2) Revises the definition of ""cigarette"" to include roll-your-own tobacco and to exclude cigars. Defines ""delivery sale"" to mean any sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to a consumer ordered by telephone, the mails, or the Internet or other online service . Redefines ""person"" to include state, local, and Indian tribal governments. Redefines ""use"" to include the consumption, storage, handling, or disposal of smokeless tobacco, in addition to cigarettes.Applies state tobacco tax reporting requirements to: (1) the sale or advertising for sale of smokeless tobacco products; (2) persons who ship or transfer cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products; and (3) the shipment of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco into a locality or Indian country that taxes the sale or use of such products. Requires sellers of tobacco products to file with the Attorney General reports filed with state tobacco tax administrators. Imposes additional information reporting requirements on such sellers, including disclosure of electronic mail addresses, website addresses, and authorized agents for service of process. Limits the use of information received from sellers of tobacco products solely for tax enforcement purposes.Expands requirements for delivery sales by requiring each delivery seller, with respect to delivery sales into a specific state and place, to: (1) comply with specified shipping and record-keeping requirements, all state, local, tribal, and other laws generally applicable to sales of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco as if such delivery sales occurred entirely within the specific state and place (including laws imposing excise taxes and licensing and tax-stamping requirements), and specified tax collection requirements; (2) include on the bill of lading for the shipping package containing cigarettes or smokeless tobacco a clear and conspicuous statement that federal law requires the payment of all applicable excise and sales taxes and compliance with applicable licensing and tax-stamping obligations; (3) comply with specified weight and age verification requirements; and (4) keep records of all delivery sales, organized by state, for four years and make such records accessible to state, local, and Indian tribe tax authorities and the Attorney General.Prohibits the delivery of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco unless the excise tax on such products has been paid and any required stamps or other indicia of payment are properly affixed to the products. Allows an exception for states that require delivery sellers to collect the tax from consumers and remit such tax to state or local tax authorities.Requires the Attorney General to compile a list of noncompliant delivery sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and to distribute such list to state attorneys general and tax administrators and common carriers and other couriers, including the U.S. Postal Service. Prohibits the delivery of any package to, or on behalf of, a noncompliant delivery seller without determining that such package does not include cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. Makes a violation of the Jenkins Act a felony (currently, a misdemeanor). Increases civil penalties for violations to the greater of $5,000 for a first violation or $10,000 for any other violation, or two percent of the gross sales of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco for the year before the violation.Grants U.S. district courts jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of this Act and to provide injunctive or equitable relief, including money damages. Empowers the Attorney General to administer and enforce this Act. Authorizes a state attorney general, a local government, an Indian tribe that levies a tax subject to this Act, or a holder of a permit as a manufacturer or importer of tobacco products or as an export warehouse proprietor (permit holder) to bring an action in U.S. district court to prevent and restrain violations of this Act. Authorizes a state attorney general or such a local government or Indian tribe to provide to the Attorney General or a U.S. Attorney evidence of a violation of this Act by any person not subject to state, local, or tribal government enforcement actions for violations of this Act.Establishes a PACT Anti-Trafficking Fund into which 50% of criminal and civil penalties collected in enforcing this Act shall be deposited and available to the Attorney General to enforce this Act and other laws relating to contraband tobacco products.Requires the Attorney General to make information on enforcement actions publicly available (including on the Internet) and to report to Congress annually on such actions.(Sec. 3) Amends the federal criminal code to treat cigarettes and smokeless tobacco as nonmailable matter and prohibit their deposit into the U.S. mails. Authorizes the U.S. Postal Service to refuse to accept nonmailable tobacco products and to issue cease and desist orders to anyone mailing such products. Imposes civil penalties for failure to comply with such orders. Exempts from such prohibition: (1) cigars; and (2) mailings within Alaska or Hawaii; or (3) mailings for business purposes between legally operating tobacco businesses, and by individuals for noncommercial, nonbusiness, and non-money making purposes.Requires the seizure and forfeiture of any cigarettes or smokeless tobacco illegally deposited into the U.S. mails. Imposes a criminal penalty for intentionally placing nonmailable tobacco products in the U.S. mails.Establishes in the Treasury the PACT Postal Service Fund to hold criminal and civil fines for mailing violations. Makes 50% of such fines available to the Postmaster General to enforce mailing restrictions on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.Allows a state, local government, or Indian tribe to obtain appropriate injunctive or equitable relief for violations of such prohibition in a civil action in a U.S. district court. (Sec. 4) Prohibits a tobacco product manufacturer or importer from selling in, delivering to, or placing for delivery sale in a state that is a party to the Master Settlement Agreement (executed November 23, 1998, by state attorneys general and certain tobacco manufacturers) any cigarette of such a manufacturer that is not in full compliance with the terms of the Model Statute or Qualifying Statute enacted by such state. Grants: (1) U.S. district courts jurisdiction to prevent and restrain prohibited sales; and (2) the Attorney General authority to administer and enforce compliance with restrictions on such sales.(Sec. 5) Authorizes any officer of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to inspect the premises and records of sellers of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. Imposes a civil penalty for noncompliance with an ATF inspection or a court order to compel such inspection.(Sec. 6) Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect, amend, or modify specified agreements or limitations relating to the collection of taxes on, and related matters regarding, cigarettes or smokeless tobacco sold in Indian country or to inhibit the coordination of law enforcement by states or other jurisdictions, including Indian tribes, with respect to interstate sales or seizures of tobacco products. (Sec. 7) Expresses the sense of Congress that unique harms are associated with online cigarette sales and that this Act is not intended to create a precedent regarding the collection of other state sales or use taxes by out-of-state entities that do not have a physical presence within the taxing state. (Sec. 8) Makes provisions of this Act effective 90 days after enactment of this Act, except for provisions relating to ATF authority, which are effective immediately.(Sec. 9) Provides that the invalidation of any provision of this Act or its application will not affect other provisions of this Act, or its application to any other person or circumstance.[/INST]

Part of the process involves a multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer- sounding voice ""digitize left PSIS"" ""digitize right PSIS"" ""digitize C7"" ""please stand with spine in neutral position"".  I'm wondering whether this doesn't really measure anything and the computer voice is to impress the victims, or whether it is measuring something that chiropractors think is useful to measure. --  haynes@cats.ucsc.edu haynes@cats.bitnet[/INST]

 IMO, the influence of Stalin, or for that matter, Ayn Rand, invalidates your  assumption that theism is the factor to be considered.  Gullibility,  blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more  reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.  Now, *some* brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism, I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?   Well, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would be irrational.  Which is it?  The first part of the second statement contains no information, because you don't say what ""the beliefs"" are.  If ""the beliefs"" are strong theism  and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in[/INST]

O.K.  It would be a shame for Cards fans on the net to go through the 1993 championship season without a  mailing list to talk on so I would be willing to look at starting one.  Except there's one little problem...  I don't know the first thing about how to do it or  what it requires in terms of resources or time.

For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful when I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also pretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because I feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I went to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.   Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So I used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually felt refreshed the next morning.

Lifetime Income Disclosure Act - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require the quarterly pension benefit statement furnished to a participant or beneficiary with the right to direct the investment of assets in his or her account under an individual account plan to include a lifetime income disclosure at least once during any 12-month period. Requires such lifetime income disclosure to set forth the lifetime income stream equivalent of the participant's or beneficiary's total benefits accrued. Defines a lifetime income stream equivalent of the total benefits accrued as the monthly annuity payment the participant or beneficiary would receive if those total accrued benefits were used to provide lifetime income streams to a qualified joint and survivor annuitant. Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) issue a model lifetime income disclosure, written in a manner which can be understood by the average plan participant; and (2) prescribe assumptions that plan administrators may use in converting total accrued benefits into lifetime income stream equivalents. Declares that no plan fiduciary, plan sponsor, or other person shall have any liability under ERISA solely by reason of the provision of lifetime income stream equivalents derived in accordance with such assumptions and related rules and including explanations contained in the model lifetime income disclosure.[/INST]

agents of  The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital but I can answer a few general points.  Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even young people find the change unsettling.  Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say - anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the change of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these patients early.  Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us) generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to the individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is the sort[/INST]

(In the fifth, the finnish goalie,  Ketterer was elected the best Finn) Has this to do with the goalies  having good days in these games, or are the finnish players just lousy scorers???  Anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally (the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy).  It looks like the goalies are getting too good.

The *real* way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the following schedule of bonuses to players on *both* teams:     For all players who participated in the game, offer $500 for each 10    minutes less than 3 hours the game took (i.e. if the game only took 2.5    hours, each player gets a bonus of $1500).     For all pitchers throwing 3 or more full innings in the game, extrapolate    the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have    thrown in a full 9 innings, and offer $500 for each number less than 120.    (If the pitcher throws a complete game with 100 pitches and 5 throws to    first he would get $7500).  I suspect you could finance this the same way Presidential campaigns are paid for.

 I've been following this train of talk, and the question of dismissing atoms as   being in some sense ""not real"" leaves me uneasy.  It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects, and therefore the   underlying thing is not necessarily real.  The tree outside my window is in   this category... is observe the light which bounces off of it, not the tree   itself.  The observation is indirect, but no more so than observations I have   made of atoms.  Also, what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done   with individual atoms.  I am thinking in particular of atom trapping   experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno   effect, where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time.  Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying   either.  One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid   technical background in the field.

 The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis.  It is a protozoan that  lives and multiplies within cells.  In cats, the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa can cross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic after the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindness and mental retardation.  Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnant women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.  In addition, whoever does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling anything else, especially food.

The historicity of the episode doesn't matter to what  follows]  I don't know whether I'm quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back to current affairs,   Among others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone else dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you will, known (according to Umar Khan) to ""Every Muslim school boy and girl"", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.   Yes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing about a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing the actor ""Gibreel"" in the role of the angel whose name he took. Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims or implies that this is what actually happened.  It's somewhat like stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed prostitute Mary[/INST]

 It sounds as though you might want to try a product such as ""super-glue"". The active ingredient is cynoacrylate, the same compound used to reconstruct bones.  I have successfully used superglue for a number of procedures on many different species of animal. If you are simply trying to adhear something to bone for several months, this would be ideal.

The federal minimum wage for tipped employees shall increase to $3.15 an hour for one year on January 1, 2016, or the first day of the third month after enactment of this Act, whichever is later. Subsequent annual adjustments of the wage increase, according to a specified formula, shall ensure that it remains equal to the wage in effect under FLSA for other employees. Employers must notify their employees of the right to retain any received tips. The separate minimum wage requirements for tipped employees shall end, effective one day after the hourly wage established for them under this Act takes effect. Any employer may pay any newly hired employee who is less than 20 years old, during the first 90 consecutive days after that employee's initial employment, a wage at a rate that is not less than the rate prescribed for employees who are engaged in commerce, reduced by $3.00 per hour.

Return to Prudent Banking Act of 2015 Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to prohibit an insured depository institution from being an affiliate of any broker or dealer, investment adviser, investment company, or any other person or entity engaged principally in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution of stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities. Prohibits officers, directors and employees of securities firms from simultaneous service on the boards of depository institutions, except in specified circumstances. Requires any such individual serving as an officer, director, employee, or other institution-affiliated party of any insured depository institution to terminate such service as soon as practicable after enactment of this Act. Requires an insured depository institution to wind-down in an orderly manner and terminate any affiliation prohibited by this Act.

Extra innings could put me well past midnight.  Even without extra innings, if the score is beyond 2-1 I can't see my family that night at all.

   You haven't been facing major league pitching.          Maybe more... you have to be good at the plate, and most  STATS did a little study in the 1993 Scoreboard book entitled ""Can you hit sacrifice flies on purpose?""  A summary of the findings:  Over the 5 year period, sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6 percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful, and  17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn't useful.  They looked at the leaders in sac flies, and found that the leaders in sac flies - in other words, the guys you would expect to be good at it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3% more often when they needed to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill. Essentially, the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often, with and without a runner on third.  STATS concludes ""So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit sacrifice flies on purpose -[/INST]

 One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves, while root beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark.  The leaves contain either no or less saffrole than the bark.  There is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from sassafras products.  I have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which is claimed to have the saffrole removed.   Well, the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make  root beer, there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human consumption. Also, when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen bark, she made a point of telling me that I couldn't buy sassafras for human  consumption.

 Actually, I was hoping for Barry Bonds.  Oh well.   First off, Jeff has had like 5 hits in the last two games, and walked *yet again*.  Sorry Ken, but Jeff King does have some power, which means his SLG won't be below .300, and his walks are *way* up.  If that increase is real, Jeff King will be an above average NL third baseman in 1993.  Jose Lind, on the other hand, *still* doesn't walk, and clearly isn't a .320 hitter.

The Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach about what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the Boston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill me in on this info?

 2 simple reasons:  (1)   Batting Williams ahead of Bonds will create a Left(Clark),        Right(Williams), Left(Bonds) situation in the middle of the       batting order.  This makes it tougher for opposing manager       to change pitchers.  (2)   Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get       more good pitches to hit.

However, when the contradictory attribute is said to be essential, ie has not got that attribute => not the A I am looking for, I can conclude that A does not exist.       That's quite like: I predict coins falling    Predicted            Happened 1.   Heads[/INST]

As quoted from <nate.1504.735838830@psygate.psych.indiana.edu> by nate@psygate.psych.indiana.edu (Nathan Engle):  What laws did they circumvent?  Being ""frightening"" isn't a crime.  Some people are afraid of young Black males.  That doesn't make the mere status of being a young Black male a crime.  The BATF itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades.  There is no evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement  personnel.  Under those circumstances, other persons have been found to be acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified armed intruders.  The charges are irrlevant anyway, since the BATF has absolutely no jurisdiction in such matters anyway.  Of course that hasn't stopped them from making other such spurious charges, such as the existence of mythical ""meth labs"".  Of course they whole ""cult"" thing indicates the level of contempt that they have for the 1st amendment.  That armed resistance, at least initially, may well have been LEGAL. [/INST]

 I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really offensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher), and read it, ""cover to cover"" (to use a phrase that seems popular here right now).  And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in New Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English: the ""yaar"" at the end of a sentence, ""Butbutbut,"" the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)  At the time I still ""sorta-kinda"" thought of myself as a muslim, and I couldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this was allegory.

Living American Wage (LAW) Act of 2009 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the federal minimum wage should, as a minimum, be adjusted every four years so that a person working for it may earn an annual income at least 15% higher than the federal poverty threshold for a family of two; (2) it should be set at a level high enough to allow two full-time minimum wage workers to earn an income above the national housing wage; and (3) Congress, any of the several states, the District of Columbia, any U.S. territories or possessions, any Indian tribe, or local or state government may establish a higher minimum wage requirement than that established in this Act. Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the federal minimum wage to at least the amount determined by the Secretary of Labor according to the formula prescribed by this Act beginning September 1, 2011. Requires the Secretary to determine such minimum wage rate by June 1, 2010, and once every four years thereafter. Prohibits any adjustment if the determination results in a minimum wage lower than the current one. Requires the minimum wage so determined to be the minimum hourly wage sufficient for a person working for it 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, to earn an annual income 15% percent higher than the federal poverty threshold for a two-person household, with one child under age 18, and living in the 48 contiguous states, as published for each such year by the Census Bureau.[/INST]

  Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything. Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical, biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.  Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation,  bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.   CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe it is a continuum.[/INST]

 Actually it was in the third period, his return did bring a spark to the crowd, and to the players, who played awesome defense in the third.   You forgot about Gretzky.  If any of these guys start scoring, the Kings will be unstoppable, if they continue the great defensive work as well.   Stauber will be in net on Tuesday.  Hopefully he will provide another stellar performance and earn the name Robb ""Stopper"" Stauber.   I believe this is how they are...I know it is Gretzky and Sandstrom, but he has been putting a number of people on left.  Also the Carson, Robataille Kurri line once ignited, will light the fire of the other lines. (Hopefully!)  It is evident that the scoring drought is getting to Luc, after his slight breakaway in the third (I think) he was steamed on the bench, this emotion might help him break his streak.  Also, I have noticed Blake has had a few really good chances to score, but has fanned, or shot wide.  Is the injury still affecting him?     The E     D  [/INST]

   Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze. This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion, a lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence.   I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.  I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over, I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again, but this time the delusion[/INST]

Ensuring Access to Primary Care for Women & Children Act Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to require that the primary care services furnished in the two years after enactment of this Act by a physician with a primary specialty designation of family medicine, general internal medicine, or pediatric medicine be paid at a rate that is not less than 100% of the payment rate that applies under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), but only if the physician self-attests as being Board certified in those areas. Extends this 100% of Medicare payment floor, subject to certain conditions, to the following providers: (1) physicians with a primary specialty designation of obstetrics and gynecology, and self-attesting they are Board certified; (2) advanced practice clinicians; (3) rural health clinics, federally-qualified health centers, or other specified health clinics; and (4) nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or certified nurse-midwives. Excludes from coverage of primary care services any such services provided in an emergency department of a hospital.

It might if you brought your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour (in which case I'd probably decide to take my kids to games on weekends, as many people do, or else be prepared to leave the game early), but from what you say later on, you don't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game. As it happens, I have a husband but no kids, and my husband usually attends games with me.

   Feel free to patronize me all you like; I need the tips. :-) Seriously, if you were insulted, I apologize.   People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the things the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to consider reasonable alternatives.  However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's no longer necessary to be an ""independent thinker"" to depart from the government's party line.  It looks like our ""independent press"" may  actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is a good sign.  I hope it continues.   Independent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one set of facts are being presented, ""coming to a conclusion"" is not the  hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability to challenge those ""facts"" critically.  The scientific method consists of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing between two hypotheses that other people have proposed. -- [/INST]

 Thank you.  I now know at least that though I may be on drugs, at least I'm not the only one.   Yes, this took some getting used to -- of course not having an Indian connection, no knowledge of hindi, etc., this was not trivial for me. I did have, thanks to the wonders of the net, ""A Glossary to *Satanic Verses*"", posted to rec.arts.books by Vijay Raghavan, which explains a lot of the Indian English constructions, Indian culture references, even the Islamic references (""Jahilia"", ""Submission"", the context of the Satanic Verses incident, etc.) -- what I have only covers the first couple of hundred pages, but it helped me get into the flow of the novel [I can mail this to anyone interested; if anyone has portions after part I, if they exist, I'd like to get those].[/INST]

 What atheists are you talking about?    IMNSHO, Abortion is the womans choice.  Homosexual sex is the choice of  the people involved.  War is sometimes necessary.    This leaves capital punishment.

 That's fascinating.  I take it that you're expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:     Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not    only invited to participate in the deliberations of our ""founding    fathers,"" but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy    arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany    Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the    Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,    and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion    Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express    a new vision that has withstood the test of time.

Small Business Venture Capital Act of 2009 - Amends the Small Business Act to reauthorize for FY2010-FY2013 the venture capital program under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (a program under which small business investment companies (SBICs) provide capital financing to small businesses). Increases the maximum amounts of outstanding leverage made available to SBICs that invest in women-owned or minority businesses. Allows SBICs who were licensed as participating securities SBICs prior to October 1, 2004, to obtain leverage based on Small Business Administration (SBA)-approved commitments rather than paid-in capital. Increases from 20% to 30% of total available private capital the maximum authorized SBIC investment in a single business (absent specific SBA approval). Requires the SBA Administrator, in selecting investment companies to participate in the New Markets Venture Capital program (NMVC program) (investment in small businesses in low-income areas), to select at least one company from each SBA geographic region. Requires the Administrator to have as a goal to enter into at least one NMVC program agreement with a company engaged primarily in the development of and investment in small manufacturers. Establishes in the Investment Division of the SBA the Office of New Markets Venture Capital. Modifies the definition of low-income geographic area to reflect the new markets tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code. Requires the Administrator to prescribe standard documents for an application for final approval of a company under the NMVC program. Allows NMVC companies to receive operational assistance grants. Requires the Administrator to grant each conditionally-approved NMVC company up to two years to raise the $5 million in private capital required for participation. Reauthorizes the NMVC program for FY2010-FY2013. Reduces the authorization for operational assistance grants.[/INST]

Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act of 2012 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require amounts received through FY2020 (currently, through FY2010) from leases under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to be available to the Secretary of the Interior for implementing the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as well as the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. Requires the Secretary to: (1) complete and finalize the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Solar Energy Development in Six Southwestern States in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) to analyze the potential impacts of a program to develop solar energy on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and any necessary amendments to land use plans for such land, and (2) amend any land use plans to provide for the development of renewable energy. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to: (1) prepare and publish a notice of intent to prepare a programmatic EIS to analyze the potential impacts of a program to develop solar and wind energy on National Forest System land and any necessary amendments to land use plans for such land, and (2) amend such plans to provide for the development of renewable energy on completion of the programmatic EIS. Requires the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to submit a report that: (1) identifies locations on land withdrawn from the public domain and reserved for military purposes that could be developed for renewable energy production, and (2) describes the administration of public land withdrawn for military purposes for the development of commercial-scale renewable energy projects. Requires the Secretary of Interior to establish a wind and solar leasing pilot program on: (1) public land administered by the Secretary or National Forest System land administered by the Secretary of Agriculture; and (2) land not excluded from the development of solar or wind energy under a land use plan established under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the National Forest Management Act of 1976, or other law. Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) make a joint determination on whether to establish such program within two years, (2) establish such program unless they determine that the program is not in the public interest and does not provide an effective means of developing such energy, and (3) require as a condition for any authorization for the development of such energy on such land the payment of a royalty. Establishes in the Treasury the Renewable Energy Resource Conservation Fund to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in regions impacted by the development of wind or solar energy for addressing and offsetting the impacts of such development on federal land, securing recreational access to federal land to provide enhanced public access to existing federal land that is inaccessible or significantly restricted, and carrying out activities authorized under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. Requires such Secretaries to determine the feasibility of carrying out a conservation banking program. Prohibits wind or solar generation projects with a capacity of 20 megawatts or more that are issued a lease, right-of-way, permit, or other authorization from being subject to the rental fee exemption for rights-of-way under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.[/INST]

Church Plan Clarification Act of 2015 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the tax treatment of church pension plans, to: (1) provide that an organization otherwise eligible to participate in a church plan shall not be aggregated with another such organization and treated as a single employer with it for pension benefit rules and testing purposes unless one such organization provides at least 80% of the operating funds for the other organization during the recipient organization's preceding tax year and there is a degree of common management or supervision between the organizations, and (2) allow transfers and mergers of qualified church retirement plans without tax consequences. The bill amends the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 to adopt benefit accrual limitations for church defined benefits plans established before 1982. The bill also: (1) preempts any state law relating to wage, salary, or payroll payment, collection, deduction, garnishment, assignment, or withholding that would prohibit or restrict the inclusion in any church plan of an automatic contribution arrangement; and (2) allows church plans and their supporting organizations to invest plan assets in a group trust (as defined by Internal Revenue Service Revenue Rulings).[/INST]

  My god, a sane person!  Somebody asking intelligent questions rather than spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to Nazi Germany.  I question, along with others, the initial raid by the ATF. There are some definite questions needing answers.    Probably.  Which is why there are so many people angry at the initial confrontation.  Why attack a compound with as many people in that compound who are willing to die for their leader?  Further, they attacked in the daylight hours without proper backup, medical support, etc.  That was rather stupid...    This I doubt.  While I question the ATF's initial raid, I believe that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single exception of the psychological ""warfare"" by blaring music, etc.  I think that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome.    See above...    Agreed.    Which is actually rather refreshing nowadays.  Most of the time, the higher-ups claim ""I don't remember..."" or ""I had no involvement...""  :-) [/INST]

 My opinion(for what it's worth) is that 40 x-rays is *way* too many.   Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays  that one should have over a given period of time because of all the  environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation  is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical  formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus  in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors  in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may  be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care  to comment?).  Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones,  I don't think that there are many drugs that can help ""dissolve"" the  kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium  have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the  aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could  speed up the process of kidney stone[/INST]

 I guess I'm still not clear on what the term ""candida bloom"" means, but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use. This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome, the ""quack"" diagnosis that has been being discussed.    Lucky how?  Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, I've mentioned to a  number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily.  It turns out most would rather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections.   Again, this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about, and has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed. There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in reducing diarrhea, but I don't think anyone would view this as a quack therapy.[/INST]

   The paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false.  Texas state officials COULD and DID investigate child abuse charges. They COULD and DID apprehend Koresh peaceably.

Export-Import Bank Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2015 This bill amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to reduce, for each of FY2015-FY2019, the authorized aggregate amount of loans, guarantees, and insurance the Export-Import Bank may have outstanding at any time. The Bank shall build to and hold in reserve, to protect against future losses, at least 5% of its aggregate amount of disbursed and outstanding loans, guarantees, and insurance. The Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012 (EIBRA) is amended to require the Government Accountability Office's quadrennial review of the adequacy of the design and effectiveness of the Bank's fraud controls to include review of the Bank's compliance with these controls. An Office of Ethics is established within the Bank to recommend administrative actions to establish or enforce standards of official conduct. A Chief Risk Officer of the Bank is established to oversee all issues relating to risk within the Bank. A Risk Management Committee is also established to: oversee periodic stress testing on the entire Bank portfolio and the monitoring of industry, geographic, and obligor exposure levels; and review all required reports on the Bank's default rate. The Bank's Inspector General shall conduct an audit or evaluation of the Bank's portfolio risk management procedures, including its implementation of the duties assigned to the Chief Risk Officer. The Bank may establish a pilot program under which it may enter into contracts and other arrangements to share risks associated with its provision of guarantees, insurance, or credit, or participation in the extension of credit. The Bank shall: (1) increase from 20% to 25% of its lending authority the amount made available to finance direct exports by small business concerns, and (2) include in its annual report to Congress a report on its programs for U.S. businesses with less than $250 million in annual sales. The Bank may use a portion of its surplus through FY2019 to update its information technology systems. The Bank, the Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee, and authority for dual use exports (of nonlethal defense articles or services primarily for civilian use) are reauthorized through FY2019. The principal amounts of medium-term financing by the Bank are limited to $25 million Increased from a minimum of $10 million to a minimum of $25 million are the amounts of: long-term loans or loan guarantees the Bank may insure, working capital export loans and guarantees to small businesses, and long-term support for projects to which certain procedures apply regarding the potential beneficial and adverse environmental effects of goods and services for which direct lending and guarantee support is requested. The Bank may never: deny an application for financing based solely on the industry, sector, or business that the application concerns; or promulgate or implement policies that discriminate against an application based solely on the industry, sector, or business that the application concerns. The EIBRA is amended to require the President instead of the Department of the Treasury to initiate and pursue negotiations to end export credit financing. The President shall propose to Congress a strategy the U.S. government will pursue with other major exporting countries, including Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members and non-OECD members, to eliminate over a period of 10 years subsidized export-financing programs, tied aid, export credits, and all other forms of government-supported export subsidies. The Bank shall study the extent to which products it offers are available and used by companies that export information and communications technology services and related goods.[/INST]

Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are  finally moving in the right direction.  They should finish over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race  in August.

Revises the purpose of management conferences convened with respect to estuaries. Requires a management conference's membership to include, among other entities, not-for-profit organizations. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) evaluate, every five years, the implementation of each comprehensive conservation and management plan developed under the Program to determine the degree to which the goals of the plan have been met; (2) submit the results of the evaluation to the appropriate management conference for review and comment; and (3) report on the results of the evaluation and make such report available to the public in the Federal Register and on the Internet. Requires management conferences to update plans 18 months after they are evaluated. Authorizes the Administrator to consider a management conference to be in probationary status if the conference has not received approval for an updated plan within three years of the date of the evaluation's publication. Requires the Administrator to: (1) reduce a grant for the implementation of a plan developed by a management conference with probationary status; and (2) terminate a management conference and cease funding for the implementation of the plan if the conference has been in probationary status for two consecutive years. Requires, after the Administrator's approval of a plan for an estuary, any federal action or activity affecting such estuary to be conducted in a manner consistent with such plan. Makes EPA the lead coordinating agency for implementing plans. Requires an agency head, in making annual budget requests, to consider the agency's responsibilities under the Program. Repeals provisions authorizing the Administrator to give grants to individuals for the development and implementation of plans.

Export-Import Bank Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2015 This bill amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to reduce, for each of FY2015-FY2019, the authorized aggregate amount of loans, guarantees, and insurance the Export-Import Bank may have outstanding at any time. The Bank shall build to and hold in reserve, to protect against future losses, at least 5% of its aggregate amount of disbursed and outstanding loans, guarantees, and insurance. The Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012 (EIBRA) is amended to require the Government Accountability Office's quadrennial review of the adequacy of the design and effectiveness of the Bank's fraud controls to include review of the Bank's compliance with these controls. An Office of Ethics is established within the Bank to recommend administrative actions to establish or enforce standards of official conduct. A Chief Risk Officer of the Bank is established to oversee all issues relating to risk within the Bank. A Risk Management Committee is also established to: oversee periodic stress testing on the entire Bank portfolio and the monitoring of industry, geographic, and obligor exposure levels; and review all required reports on the Bank's default rate. The Bank's Inspector General shall conduct an audit or evaluation of the Bank's portfolio risk management procedures, including its implementation of the duties assigned to the Chief Risk Officer. The Bank may establish a pilot program under which it may enter into contracts and other arrangements to share risks associated with its provision of guarantees, insurance, or credit, or participation in the extension of credit. The Bank shall: (1) increase from 20% to 25% of its lending authority the amount made available to finance direct exports by small business concerns, and (2) include in its annual report to Congress a report on its programs for U.S. businesses with less than $250 million in annual sales. The Bank may use a portion of its surplus through FY2019 to update its information technology systems. The Bank, the Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee, and authority for dual use exports (of nonlethal defense articles or services primarily for civilian use) are reauthorized through FY2019. The principal amounts of medium-term financing by the Bank are limited to $25 million Increased from a minimum of $10 million to a minimum of $25 million are the amounts of: long-term loans or loan guarantees the Bank may insure, working capital export loans and guarantees to small businesses, and long-term support for projects to which certain procedures apply regarding the potential beneficial and adverse environmental effects of goods and services for which direct lending and guarantee support is requested. The Bank may never: deny an application for financing based solely on the industry, sector, or business that the application concerns; or promulgate or implement policies that discriminate against an application based solely on the industry, sector, or business that the application concerns. The EIBRA is amended to require the President instead of the Department of the Treasury to initiate and pursue negotiations to end export credit financing. The President shall propose to Congress a strategy the U.S. government will pursue with other major exporting countries, including Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members and non-OECD members, to eliminate over a period of 10 years subsidized export-financing programs, tied aid, export credits, and all other forms of government-supported export subsidies. The Bank shall study the extent to which products it offers are available and used by companies that export information and communications technology services and related goods.[/INST]

Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2007 or the MCAP Act - Sets forth provisions regulating lawsuits for health care liability claims related to the provision of health care services. Sets a statute of limitations of three years after the date of manifestation of injury or one year after the claimant discovers the injury, with certain exceptions. Requires a court to impose sanctions for the filing of frivolous lawsuits. Limits noneconomic damages to $250,000 from the provider or health care institution, but no more than $500,000 from multiple health care institutions. Makes each party liable only for the amount of damages directly proportional to such party's percentage of responsibility. Allows the court to restrict the payment of attorney contingency fees. Limits the fees to a decreasing percentage based on the increasing value of the amount awarded. Prescribes qualifications for expert witnesses. Requires the court to reduce damages received by the amount of collateral source benefits to which a claimant is entitled, unless the payor of such benefits has the right to reimbursement or subrogation under federal or state law. Authorizes the award of punitive damages only where: (1) it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that a person acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant or deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury the claimant was substantially certain to suffer; and (2) compensatory damages are awarded. Limits punitive damages to the greater of two times the amount of economic damages or $250,000. Prohibits a health care provider from being named as a party in a product liability or class action lawsuit for prescribing or dispensing a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription drug, biological product, or medical device for an approved indication.

 I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr, specifically because I thought it would help them win at least one playoff series.  However, I don't think the Leafs can be faulted either...there is nothing to say that Felix won't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come.    Anyway, does anybody else find it ironic that Fuhr is up against Moog? (or at least he was until a guy named Alex showed up....:-) )  [/INST]

Sometimes it seems like there are a lot of them because they're generally more vocal than their opposition, but there really aren't that many Krusaders.

The problem with your nihilistic approach, Roger, is that it takes all the sense out of the game.  By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons.  After all, any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't.  Roger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead?  Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence?  Teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else in their division.  If they don't make the post-season, they don't win the Series.  Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring-collecting?

    I think this should be illuminating to all. Let me make a first suggestion. When Arabic words, especially technical ones, become of use  let us define them for those, especially atheists, to whom they may not be terribly familiar. Please also note that though I did initially refer to Khomeini as a heretic for what I understood to be a claim -- rejected  by you since -- of personal infallibility, I withdraw this as a basis for such a statement. I conditionally retain this reference in regard to Khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the  so-called ""Twelve Imams,"" which is in clear conflict with the Qur'an  in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example higher than that of the Muhammad, in that the Qur'an shows that the Prophet was clearly fallible, as well as (it appears, given your abstruse theological statment regarding the ""natures""  of the Twelve Imams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the  remainder of humanity, with the possible exception of Muhammad,  something which verges on the sin of association.

21st Century Charter School Act - Amends the Charter School program of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Makes public and private nonprofit entities eligible for program grants. (Currently, state educational entities are eligible for such grants.) Allows grantees to award subgrants to charter school developers or nonprofit charter support organizations and award them multiple grants to support multiple campuses of a public charter school. Sets forth additional factors that are to work in favor of grant applicants, including that their state gives public charter schools funding commensurate with that provided to other public schools, has no cap on such schools, and gives the schools a high degree of autonomy. Authorizes the use of subgrants to plan and implement, or expand existing, public charter schools. Authorizes grantees to use a portion of the grant funds reserved for administrative expenses to improve public charter school authorizing policies and practices in their area. Expands the portion of funds grantees may use in establishing revolving loan funds for loans to subgrantees for planning and operating a public charter school. Requires each public charter school participating in the program to have an independent governing board that enters into a performance-based agreement with an authorized public chartering agency that describes: (1) how student performance will be measured pursuant to the state assessments required of other schools, and (2) the criteria for renewal or revocation of their charter. Prohibits such schools from giving admissions preference to any student on the basis of prior academic achievement. Establishes two new grant programs awarding grants to: (1) public charter schools, public and private nonprofit entities, charter school developers, and nonprofit charter support organizations to disseminate charter school innovations to other schools and states; and (2) public and private nonprofit entities to demonstrate innovative credit enhancement initiatives that assist public charter schools in covering the cost of acquiring, constructing, and renovating facilities.[/INST]

When ordered to intentionally walk a batter who had hot-dogged on him in two previous at-bats, Drysdale reared back with the first pitch and drilled him right in the ribs.  His manager came storming out of the dugout and yelled ""What did you do that for ?""  Drysdale growled back, ""What are you complaining for ? I saved you three pitches !""  Incidentally, if this is true, I'd love to know the other people involved.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ted Kury            | ""One man stands... and the wall, cracks... and the wall,   SUNY at Buffalo     | cracks... and the wall, cracks... and the wall comes Dept. of Economics  | crumbling down.""                - Anthrax        [/INST]

 Consider special relativity.  It hasn't be proved, nor has it been disproved.  No one has a proof one way or the other, but many people are interested in it!   I've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the existence of God one way or the other.  The two possibilities are supernaturalism and naturalism.  Of course no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with naturalism.  In naturalism, any phenomenon that could be described as God is considered part of the natural world, to be studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance).   For example, if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced, ``I am God, I exist, and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity,'' and if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist) would say, ``Boy, we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we thought we did, and that loud voice is something new.  Perhaps we didn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.''   I'm sure glad you don't know where I live, since you don't[/INST]

American Entrepreneurship and Investment Act of 2014 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make the EB-5 immigrant investor program permanent. Increases the targeted employment area set-aside. Includes in the definition of targeted employment area (TEA): (1) a military installation closed pursuant to a base closure law; (2) a county with a 20% or greater population decline since 1970; and (3) an area within a federal, state, county, or city economic development incentive program. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to defer to state TEA designations. Provides for five-year Consumer Price Index-based adjustments to the required EB-5 investment amount beginning on January 1, 2016. Permits job creation requirements to include employment measured in full-time equivalents, such as intermittent or seasonal employment opportunities and construction jobs. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a preapproval procedure for commercial enterprises that allows a regional center to apply for preapproval of a new commercial enterprise before an alien files a petition for classification by reason of investment in such enterprise; and (2) defer to certain prior favorable EB-5 determinations except in the case of fraud, material change, or legal deficiency. Prohibits a person who has been found liable for specified criminal or civil activities from serving as an owner, director, or officer of a regional center. Requires EB-5 petitions to be adjudicated within 180 days unless additional information is required. Revises the criteria under which a immigrant investor or entrepreneur shall have his or her conditional permanent resident status terminated. Provides that the child of an alien investor whose conditional permanent resident status is terminated shall continue to be considered a child of the alien investor for purposes of a subsequent immigrant petition by the alien investor if the child remains unmarried and the alien investor's subsequent petition is filed within one year after termination of status. Provides for: (1) a consolidated petition by an alien investor and his or her spouse and children, and (2) premium petition processing for a $5,000 fee. Prescribes criteria for national interest waivers for: (1) physicians working in shortage areas or veterans facilities, and (2) entrepreneurs and job creators who have engaged in a new commercial enterprise in the United States that has benefitted the U.S. economy and who have satisfied certain employment creation requirements. Exempts spouses and children of EB-5 immigrants from EB-5 admissions limits. Authorizes concurrent filing of EB-5 petitions and applications for status adjustment to conditional lawful permanent resident. Eliminates the per-country limit for employment-based immigrants and increases the per-country limit for family-based immigrants. Amends the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 to eliminate the requirement that the annual Chinese immigrant visas be reduced by a specified amount to offset status adjustments under that Act.

        ^^^^^^^^^^  The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.  As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.[/INST]

[Interchange on Hoban deleted]   Only those you haven't actually read?  Sorry, but the irony remains.   So although you don't agree with the fatwa, and apparently don't think Rushdie should be killed for his book, yet you think he is not due sympathy for being being under this threat.  Furthermore you base this reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular well-known story which -- if true -- might reflect poorly on the absolute truth of your religion.  Yet, this opinion is formed without recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context, accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this book contains and what the author's motivations are.  And then you come forward and recommend another book which touches on (presumably ""plays with"") religious/historical material because you find its overall presentation neutral![/INST]

Standards to Provide Educational Achievement for Kids Act or the SPEAK Act - Amends the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (the Act) to require the Commissioner for Educational Statistics to add science to the mandatory biennial national and state academic achievement assessments of students in grades four, eight, and twelve in reading and mathematics. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require states receiving school improvement funds to participate in such science assessments of students in grades four and eight, beginning with the 2010-2011 school year. Amends the Act to task the National Assessment Governing Board with creating or adopting voluntary American education content standards in mathematics and science for kindergarten through grade 12 which reflect the knowledge students need to enter college or the workforce and compete in the global economy. Requires the Secretary of Education to establish the American Standards Incentive fund to award competitive four-year grants to states which agree to: (1) adopt such voluntary mathematics and science standards as the core of their own academic content standards in such subjects; and (2) align their teacher certification and professional development requirements to such standards. Provides additional funds to successful grantees for the enhancement of their student performance data systems. Authorizes the Secretary to extend by two to four years for such grantees the 12-year period at the end of which students must meet or exceed state academic performance standards established under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.[/INST]

Nurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act or the NAS Healthy Babies Act (Sec. 2) This bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report on neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which results from a newborn's exposure to addictive opiate drugs while in the mother's womb. Specifically, the GAO shall report on: the prevalence of NAS, NAS treatment services for which coverage is available under state Medicaid programs, the settings and associated reimbursement methodologies for NAS treatment, the prevalence of utilization of various care settings under state Medicaid programs for NAS treatment, any federal barriers to treating infants with NAS under state Medicaid programs, and best practices for treating infants with NAS. The GAO shall also report on its recommendations for improvements that will ensure access to NAS treatment under state Medicaid programs. (Sec. 3) The bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to exclude abuse-deterrent formulations of prescription drugs from the requirement that manufacturers of single-source or innovator drugs pay additional rebates to state Medicaid programs. (Sec. 4) Under current law, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must use predictive modeling and other analytic technologies to identify improper Medicaid claims. The bill prohibits a state agency from using or disclosing such technologies except for purposes of administering a state Medicaid program or Children's Health Insurance Program. A state agency shall have in effect adequate data security and control policies to ensure that access to such information is restricted to authorized persons for authorized uses.

 I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist. No scientist would take your statement --- ""no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome"" --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the ""crazy"" theory were true, you probably couldn't find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals, many of them appear to get better.    So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling back and forth[/INST]

Title I: Science Scholarships - 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act - (Sec. 103) Requires the National Science Foundation (NSF), in carrying out the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program (formerly, the Robert Noyce Scholarship program), to increase the number of elementary and secondary mathematics and science teachers having both exemplary subject knowledge and pedagogical skills by up to 10,000 per year. (Sec. 104) Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 (the Act) to revise requirements for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, which provides scholarships, stipends, and teacher training to science, mathematics, and engineering students and professionals in exchange for service as elementary or secondary school teachers. Opens the program to all undergraduate students. (Currently, only juniors and seniors may participate.) Requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) that receive grants to: (1) provide participants with the academic courses and field teaching experiences necessary for teacher certification or licensing, including summer internships for freshmen students; and (2) include mathematics, science, and engineering faculty in developing and implementing the program. Authorizes IHEs to involve teacher leaders in the development of pedagogical content and the supervision of students in their field teaching experiences. Requires the Director to broadly disseminate information about the grant application process to ensure the participation of a diversity of IHEs. Increases the maximum duration of student scholarships from two to three years, professional stipends from one year to 16 months, and the minimum yearly scholarship amount from $7,500 to $10,000. Eliminates the requirement that scholarship recipients serve in high-need areas, but reduces their service obligation by one year for doing so. Requires the Director to establish for individuals with a service obligation an information clearinghouse on teaching opportunities in high-need LEAs. Authorizes the Director of the NSF to accept private donations for the program. Requires the Director to report to Congress within four years of this Act's enactment on the program's effectiveness. Authorizes appropriations for the program for FY2008-FY2012. Requires the Secretary to establish, under the program, a Special Partnership program that provides competitive grants to IHEs that partner with one or more private nonprofit organizations, local or state governments, and businesses to provide stipends, courses, and support to mathematics, science, and engineering professionals who enroll in an educational program enabling them to obtain teacher certification or licensing within 16 months. Requires selection of stipend recipients primarily on the basis of their content knowledge of science or mathematics as demonstrated on a required test. Requires stipend recipients to complete four years of service as mathematics or science teachers in public secondary schools. Requires partnership members to identify a nonfederal source of salary supplements for stipend recipients fulfilling their service obligation. Title II: Mathematics and Science Education Improvement - (Sec. 201) Revises requirements for the Mathematics and Science Education Partnership program (Partnership program), which provides grants to IHEs or nonprofit institutions for the improvement of elementary and secondary mathematics and science instruction. Requires that IHE grantees enter into partnerships though one or more of their science, engineering, or mathematics departments. Includes IHE faculty, in addition to local educational agencies (LEAs), states, and businesses, among the entities with which IHEs and nonprofit institutions may partner. Adds to the list of grant fund uses: (1) teacher training in the provision of challenging mathematics, science, and technology college preparatory courses, including advanced placement and international baccalaureate courses; (2) laboratory training and support for teachers; (3) model induction programs for teachers in their first two years of teaching; (4) technology, in addition to mathematics and science, in the student enrichment programs which are to include after-school programs and summer camps for female, minority, and disabled students; (5) master's degree programs for in-service teachers; and (6) the development and dissemination of curriculum tools that foster inventiveness and innovation. Requires grantees providing challenging college preparatory courses to encourage companies employing scientists, mathematicians, or engineers to provide mentors to teachers and students. Sets minimum and maximum grant amounts. Requires the Director to provide to Congress: (1) within one year of this Act's enactment, a determination as to which completed partnership projects should be seen as models to be replicated on a more expansive basis; and (2) within four years of this Act's enactment, a summary of partnership evaluations that describes recommended changes to the program. (Sec. 202) Requires the Director to establish a grant program for summer or academic year teacher institutes or workshops authorized under the Partnership program, including teacher training in the provision of challenging mathematics, science, and technology college preparatory courses. Gives grant priority to applicants proposing to attract teachers from certain high-need LEAs. Allows grantees under the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century program to operate one- to two-week summer teacher institutes. Authorizes FY2008-FY2012 appropriations to: (1) the NSF for the teacher institute or workshop grants; and (2) to the Department of Energy (DOE) for the Laboratory Science Teacher Professional Development program. (Sec. 203) Requires the master's degree programs for in-service mathematics and science teachers under the Partnership program to be designed to allow teachers to enroll as part-time students and earn their degree within three years. Authorizes grantees to use funds for the development and acquisition of educational materials and equipment, and to provide stipends to students that cover their costs of attendance. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2012 for such programs. (Sec. 204) Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as limiting the authority of states or local school boards to determine the curricula of their students. (Sec. 205) Revises the Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Talent Expansion program to require the Director to issue grants to IHEs for the creation of centers to develop and disseminate curriculum, teaching methods, and ways to better train professors and teacher assistants to increase the number and performance of undergraduate students in such courses. Requires the Director to strive to increase the representation of students from secondary schools that serve a high concentration of low-income families, when providing grants under the Talent Expansion program to increase the number of students studying and completing bachelor's degrees, concentrations, or certificates in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology. Authorizes appropriations for the Talent Expansion program for FY2008-FY2012, with specified amounts set aside for the centers. (Sec. 206) Redefines a ""high-need local educational agency,"" for purposes of the Act, as a LEA that is receiving grants under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 as a result of serving a high concentration of children from low-income families and experiencing a shortage of highly qualified science, mathematics, or engineering teachers. (Sec. 207) Replaces the term ""master teacher"" with the term ""teacher leader"" each time it appears in the Act. (Sec. 208) Requires the Director to establish a Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science research pilot program awarding grants to partnerships between IHEs, high-need LEAs, and businesses or nonprofit organizations to improve laboratories and provide instrumentation as part of a comprehensive effort to improve the quality of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction in secondary schools. Requires such partnerships to include significant teacher training, unless such training is addressed through other means. Limits the federal share of partnership costs to 50%. Requires the Director to report to Congress within five years regarding the program's effect on student performance. Authorizes appropriations for the program for FY2008-FY2011. (Sec. 209) Requires the Director to report to Congress within two years on the extent to which IHEs are donating used laboratory equipment to elementary and secondary schools.[/INST]

A really sad op-ed appeared in my school's newpaper today.  It claimed that full-auto weapons are illegal in the U.S. I understand that full-auto weapons made and registered before May 19, 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states.  Is Texas one of those states?  Can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been  killed by legal full-auto weapons in the U.S.?  And finally, I think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest of facts on the Waco incident.  In particular, I would like a source for the FBI/BATF mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab, and information on the beginning of the raid, specifically BATF lies.  I am also interested in past BATF no-knock warrents which have lead to personal and property damage against innocent citizens.  I intend to put together a reply to this op-ed very soon.

 Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause pregnancy, even in the presence of a hymen. I doubt that sperm could make  it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum, but it might be possible.  So, it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant. Also, some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse without rupturing. The problem when investigating these phenomenae is, of course, getting an honest account of what exactly happened.[/INST]

Title I: Democratic, Economic, and Development Assistance for Pakistan - (Sec. 101) Authorizes the President to provide assistance to Pakistan to support: (1) democratic institutions; (2) efforts to expand the rule of law, build capacity, transparency, and trust in government institutions, as well as promote human rights; (3) economic freedom and development; (4) investments in people, particularly women and children; and (5) public diplomacy to combat militant extremism and promote a better understanding of the United States. Encourages the President to use Pakistani firms and organizations to provide such assistance. Obligates specified funds for: (1) FY2010 police professionalization, equipping, and training; (2) administrative expenses; and (3) establishment of a Chief of Mission fund to provide assistance to address urgent needs or opportunities or for humanitarian relief. Directs the President to notify Congress prior to obligating FY2010-FY2014 assistance under this section and to include in such notification a description of the purpose and conditions attached to any such assistance. (Sec. 102) Authorizes FY2010-FY2014 appropriations for assistance to Pakistan under this title and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Prohibits any of such funds from being made available to Pakistan unless the Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report has been submitted to Congress. Limits the amount of such funds available to Pakistan unless the President's Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan certifies to Congress that assistance to Pakistan has made or is making substantial progress toward achieving U.S. assistance objectives. Provides for a national security waiver of funding restrictions. Expresses the sense of Congress that, subject to an improving political and economic climate in Pakistan, there should be authorized to be appropriated up to $1.5 billion for each of FY2015-FY2019 for assistance to Pakistan under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. (Sec. 103) Directs the Inspector General of the Department, the Inspector General of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the inspectors general of other federal departments and agencies (other than the Inspector General of the Department of Defense (DOD)) carrying out programs under this title to audit fund expenditures. Authorizes the establishment of in-country field offices in Pakistan. Allocates FY2010-FY2014 funds for such purposes. Title II: Security Assistance for Pakistan - (Sec. 201) States that the purposes of assistance under this title are to: (1) support Pakistan's paramount national security need to win the ongoing counterinsurgency within its borders in accordance with its national security interests; (2) work with the government of Pakistan to improve border security and to coordinate action against extremist and terrorist targets; and (3) help strengthen the institutions of democratic governance and promote control of military institutions by a democratically elected civilian government. (Sec. 202) Authorizes FY2010-FY2014 appropriations for Pakistan for: (1) military education and training under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; and (2) purchase of defense articles, defense services, and military education and training under the Arms Export Control Act. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) a substantial amount of such funds should be used for counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and civil-military relations purposes; and (2) the United States should facilitate Pakistan's establishment of a program to provide reconstruction assistance in areas damaged by combat operations. Authorizes the Secretary, in order to foster greater mutual respect for and understanding of the principle of civilian rule of the military, to establish an exchange program between military and civilian personnel of Pakistan and: (1) military and civilian personnel of countries determined to be in the process of consolidating and strengthening a democratic form of government; or (2) military and civilian personnel of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries. Authorizes FY2010-FY2014 appropriations. (Sec. 203) Prohibits FY2010-FY2014 security-related assistance and arms transfers to Pakistan until the Secretary certifies that: (1) Pakistan's government is continuing to cooperate with the United States to dismantle supplier networks relating to the acquisition of nuclear weapons-related materials; (2) Pakistan's government is making significant efforts towards combating terrorist groups; and (3) Pakistan's security forces are not subverting Pakistan's political or judicial processes. Prohibits any funds appropriated for security-related assistance for FY2010-FY2014, or any amounts appropriated to the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund established under the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, from being used to make payments relating to specified letters of offer and acceptance between the Pakistan and the United States, other than for construction. Provides for a national security waiver of such prohibitions. (Sec. 204) Prescribes FY2010 requirements for the Department's Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. States that Fund amounts are to be used by the Secretary to build Pakistan's counterinsurgency capability under the same conditions as apply to FY2009. (Sec. 205) Restricts the provision of FY2010-FY2014 direct cash security-related U.S. assistance or non-assistance payments to Pakistan to only civilian authorities of a civilian government. Provides for a national security waiver of such restriction. Title III: Strategy, Accountability, Monitoring, and Other Provisions - (Sec. 301) Directs the Secretary to submit a Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report to Congress. Requires the Plan to include descriptions of: (1) assistance objectives; (2) programs and assistance levels; (3) roles to be played by Pakistani national, regional, and local entities; and (4) steps taken to prevent assistance from being awarded to terrorist-affiliated individuals or entities. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the achievement of U.S. national security goals to eliminate terrorist threats and close safe havens in Pakistan requires a comprehensive plan that utilizes all elements of national power; and (2) it is critical to Pakistan's long-term prosperity and security to strengthen regional relationships among India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Directs the President to: (1) develop an interagency regional security strategy to eliminate terrorist threats and close safe havens in Pakistan, including working with the government of Pakistan and other governments and organizations to implement counterinsurgency and counterterrorism efforts in Pakistan's border areas, including the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan, parts of Balochistan, and parts of Punjab; and (2) report to Congress regarding such strategy. Directs the Secretary to submit a FY2010-FY2014 security-related assistance plan to Congress.

 You, along with Mario Lemieux, must be from another planet.  The only difference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo. Washington, Abe Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come from the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties, but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team an advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this year, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about being hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting them up.)

The FDA must convene an advisory committee on labeling opioids for pediatric use before approving any such labeling.

        Well, in my opinion the Canucks played a really strong game. I was especially pleased by a very strong game from Linden - I think he could be a key to success for them this year.  Defensively, they really had a strong game.  Hardly heard Selanne's name all night. Craven also played one of his best games since coming over.  With a few exceptions, they really didn't let the high-flying Jets do much high-flying.  I thought the Jets defence looked overmatched by the Canucks forwards - they will have to improve on that if they want to make this a series.      In short, it was a great start! [/INST]

I raced home from work early (4:30 Pacific) to catch the game, but   ALAS, it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would   show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday.  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind.   I didn't mind THAT MUCH.  I watched the game (hockey is MUCH better   than NO hockey).  During the game their were no video highlights from the   Patrick division.  What the hell was going on?  At least they should show   video highlights of the other games (especially the NYI/Caps game that was   so close).  My father (lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky [Bumbf*ck, Egypt])   got to watch the Pens game[/INST]

Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012 - Requires the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Federal Housing Commissioner each to establish a pilot program to encourage the use of shared appreciation mortgage modifications that: (1) are designed to return greater cash flow to investors than other loss-mitigation activities, including foreclosure; and (2) result in positive net present value for the investor. Requires a shared appreciation mortgage modification to: (1) reduce by specified action the loan-to-value ratio of a covered mortgage to 95% within 3 years; (2) reduce the interest rate if such a principal reduction would not result in an affordable reduced monthly payment; (3) reduce to a specified amount any periodic payment the homeowner is required to make; (4) require the homeowner to pay the investor, after refinancing or selling the real property securing a covered mortgage, up to 50% of the amount of any increase in the value of the real property during a specified period; and (5) result in a positive net present value for the investor after taking into account the principal reduction and, if necessary, any interest rate reduction.[/INST]

While watching the Penguins/Devils game last night, I saw the ""slash"" that Barrasso took on the neck.  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his jugular vein cut by a skate.  I think he was a Sabre, but I'm not positive. Does anyone remember/know his name?  What has happened to him since?  What about the player whose skate cut the goalie?  Name?  Info?

Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2007 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to modify the definition of ""religion"" for purposes of coverage under that Act by requiring employers to make an affirmative and bona fide effort to reasonably accommodate the religious practices of employees. Defines the term ""perform the essential functions"" to exclude practices having a temporary or tangential impact on an employee's ability to perform job functions, such as practices relating to clothing or taking time off work. Sets forth factors to consider in determining whether an accommodation causes undue hardship. Defines ""employee"" to require an ability to perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. Requires removal of the conflict between employment requirements and the employee's religious practices in order for an accommodation to be considered reasonable. Considers an employer's refusal to permit an employee's use of general leave to remove a religious conflict solely because the leave will be used to accommodate religious practices to be an unlawful employment practice.

Hey folks,  Saw the Giants play ball at the 'Stick Saturday, April 17.  It was the game where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out, two-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn't the game where the fans  threw the give-away ""fotoballs"" onto the field in response to the homer -- too bad, huh?)  Well, the 'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it was cold then.  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick.  The wind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.  At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths the infield) and grab the trash.  It might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given anything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins[/INST]

TRIA Reform Act of 2014 - Title I: TRIA Reform - (Sec. 102) Amends the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) to extend the Terrorism Insurance Program through December 31, 2019, and to revise requirements for the Program. (Sec. 103) Requires the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary), before certifying an act of terrorism, to consult with the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) instead of obtaining concurrence with the Secretary of State (as under current law). Repeals the prohibition against certifying an act of terrorism if resulting property and casualty insurance losses do not exceed $5 million. Requires a preliminary notice that an act is expected to be certified within 15 days after its occurrence or after receipt of an insurer's petition for a preliminary decision. Requires a final certification within 90 days after occurrence or receipt of such a petition. Requires treatment of a particular act as not being an act of terrorism if the Secretary neither certifies nor determines not to certify the act within the 90-day period. (Sec. 104) Requires each certification of an act of terrorism, beginning January 1, 2016, to include a determination of whether it involves nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological (NBCR) terrorism. Requires the federal share of payments thereafter for: (1) non-NBCR acts of terrorism to be reduced annually to 80% of insured losses by 2019, and (2) NBCR acts of terrorism to be 85% of insured losses. Increases Program minimum aggregate loss trigger levels for the payment of compensation for non-NBCR acts of terrorism each year from 2016 to 2019. Sets the minimum trigger level for acts of NCBR terrorism at $100 million. Prohibits the Secretary, in determining such aggregate losses, from considering any act resulting, in the aggregate, in less than $50 million in insured losses. (Sec. 105) Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations to allow small insurers voluntarily to opt-out of TRIA's mandatory availability requirement if the state's insurance regulatory authority determines that the insurer meets requirements for financial hardship or financial infeasibility for providing coverage for insured losses. (Sec. 106) Increases from 133% to 150% of any mandatory recoupment amount the terrorism loss risk-spreading premium (surcharge) collected for repayment of federal financial assistance provided in connection with all acts of terrorism (or acts of war, in the case of workers compensation). (Sec. 107) Revises the formula for determining the annual insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount after January 1, 2016. (Sec. 108) Requires the Secretary to begin collecting terrorism loss risk-spreading premiums within 18 months after the occurrence of the certified act for which they are imposed. (Sec. 109) Requires the Secretary to establish an Advisory Committee to encourage the creation and development of risk-sharing mechanisms by insurers to reinsure voluntarily among themselves terrorism losses that are not subject to reimbursement under the Program. (Sec. 110) Directs the Secretary to: (1) require insurers participating in the Program to submit appropriate information regarding insurance coverage for their terrorism losses, and (2) use this information to analyze Program effectiveness. (Sec. 111) Requires insurers to disclose to the policyholder the premium charged for covered insured losses and the federal share of compensation for insured losses only at the time of offer and renewal (currently, also at the time of purchase) of the policy. (Sec. 113) Requires the Secretary to conduct an annual study of small insurers participating in the Program to identify any competitive challenges small insurers face in the terrorism risk insurance marketplace. (Sec. 114) Requires the Directors of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to study the feasibility of applying accrual accounting concepts to budgeting for the costs of this and other federal insurance programs. (Sec. 115) Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to study the viability of: (1) federal assessment and collection of upfront premiums from insurers that participate in the Program; and (2) creation of a capital reserve fund, requiring participating insurers to dedicate capital specifically for terrorism losses before they are incurred. Title II: National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform - National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2014 - (Sec. 202) Amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to repeal the contingent conditions under which the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) shall not be established. Establishes the NARAB without contingent conditions as an independent nonprofit corporation to prescribe, on a multi-state basis, licensing and insurance producer qualification requirements and conditions. Prohibits the NARAB from merging with or into any other private or public entity. Requires the NARAB, without affecting state regulatory authority, to provide a mechanism for the adoption and multi-state application of requirements and conditions pertaining to: (1) licensing, continuing education, and other qualifications of non-NARAB insurance producers; (2) resident or nonresident insurance producer appointments; (3) supervision and disciplining of such producers; and (4) the setting of licensing fees for insurance producers. Makes any state-licensed insurance producer eligible to join the NARAB, except during a period of license suspension or revocation.

Prohibits the NARAB from adopting any qualification less protective to the public than that contained in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Producer Licensing Model Act. Prescribes procedures for authorized information sharing pursuant to a request by a licensed insurance producer. Authorizes the NARAB to deny membership to any state-licensed insurance producer for failure to meet membership criteria. States that NARAB membership authorizes an insurance producer to engage in the business of insurance in any state for any lines of insurance specified in the producer's home state license, including claims adjustments and settlement, risk management, and specified insurance-related consulting activities. Makes NARAB membership equivalent to a nonresident insurance producer license for specified purposes. Empowers the NARAB to act as agent for any member for the purpose of remitting licensing fees to a state.

Local and Municipal Health Care Choice Act of 2015 Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize a local government in a secondary state to provide group health coverage to its officers, employees, or retirees (and their dependents) through a local government employee health benefits pool or program authorized under the laws of a primary state. Defines: (1) ""primary state"" to mean the state designated by a local government employee health benefits pool or program as the state whose covered laws shall govern the pool or program in the issuance of group health coverage, and (2) ""secondary state"" to mean any state that is not the primary state. Makes a local government employee health benefits pool or program eligible to offer group health coverage to officials, employees, and retirees (and their dependents) of a local government located in a secondary state through an interlocal agreement with such local government, or as approved by an applicable state authority in such secondary state, unless objections are made within a specified time frame by the municipal league or association or county association located in the secondary state. Requires the covered laws of the primary state to apply to group health coverage offered by a local government employee health benefits pool or program in the primary state and in any secondary state, but only if the coverage and the pool or program comply with conditions set forth in this Act with respect to the offering of coverage in any secondary state. Defines ""covered laws"" as the laws, rules, regulations, agreements, and orders pertaining to: group health coverage issued by a local government employee health benefits pool or program; the offer, sale, rating, renewal, and issuance of group health coverage to local government officials, employees, and retirees or their dependents; the management, operations, and investment activities of such a pool or program; loss control and claims administration for such a pool or program with respect to liability for which the pool or program provides coverage; or the payment of applicable premium and other taxes that are levied on health insurance issuers, brokers, or policyholders under the laws of the state. Excludes from such term any law, rule, regulation, agreement, or order governing the use of care or cost management techniques. Exempts a local government pool or program that offers group health coverage in a secondary state to the officers, employees, or retirees of a local government located in such secondary state from any covered laws of the secondary state. Permits a secondary state to require such a pool or program to register with an applicable authority in such state and to comply with any state law regarding fraud and abuse or unfair claims settlement practices.[/INST]

 I looked up ""might"" to see why you selected that particular word, and discovered the line "". . . to express permission, liberty, probability, possibility . . .""  It also said something about being a ""polite"" alternative to ""may.""  The presence of ""probability, possibility"" can certainly be used to partially explain your word selection.   So, I'd say to all extents and purposes, ""Yes, you might.""  In fact, you did. (Not that you were asking *me* specifically.)   The next question is, why would a mailing list be ""more"" appropriate? We don't all get mailing lists.  We surely don't all get mailing lists about the teams about which we are most enthused.

The AP representative in the press box is actually a STATS reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking.  And anybody can do it.)  The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago, some quick error  checking is done, and then STATS sends it to the AP.  I'm not sure where the appreveiations come in hear.  I don't think it is at STATS's.  It may just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day.   While I'm mentioning STATS reporters, they are always looking for new people.

 (WITH-COUNTERFLAME-ENABLED   Columbus was indeed a crank, but not in the manner you think.   The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail.  It was  also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles, and that you could  not reach Asia bo going west with current technology -- you would neither be  able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing  weather.  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world.  Instead,  they expected him to die at sea.   Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles,  making the trip practical.   Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference is  indeed 25K miles.   Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place right  about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles.

    Society is the collection of individuals which will fall under self-defined rules.  In terms of UN decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented at the UN are considered part of that society. If we then look at US federal laws provided by representatives of purely US citizens then the society for that case would be the citizens of the US and so on.   ""Acceptable"" are those behaviours which are either legislated for the society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are non-verbally and, in effect, non-consciously, such as picking your nose on the Oprah Winfrey show, no-one does it, but there is no explicit law against doing it. In many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a behaviour is ""acceptable"", but one can deduce these behaviours by observation.    In an increasingly litigation mad society, this trap is becoming exceedingly difficult to avoid. With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures in American (and Australian, to bring in my local perspective) culture the boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may eventually become the definition of moral behaviour.

Civil Access to Justice Act of 2009 - Amends the Legal Services Corporation Act to reauthorize the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) at increased levels for FY2010-FY2015. Requires the LSC Board of Directors to include at least one individual with financial or audit experience. Eliminates state advisory councils. Requires the LSC to establish: (1) a protocol for the receipt of donations; (2) an audit committee, a finance committee, and a governance and performance review committee; (3) a continuity of operations plan; and (4) an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Requires the LSC to promote recruitment and retention of highly qualified staff members for all grantees, contractees, or recipients of financial assistance through the Pilot Loan Repayment Assistance Program or other appropriate programs. Limits the coverage of prohibited purpose provisions of federal law only to recipient use of funds from the LSC itself. (Thus lifts such restrictions, except those related to abortion litigation, on the use of state and local funds and private donations.) Permits only class action suits arising under established state or federal statutory or established judicial case law. Revises eligibility requirements for LSC grantees and funds recipients, extending specific eligibility to those seeking assistance with matters relating to home foreclosure or mortgage default or delinquency. Requires distribution of LSC funds on the basis of a system of competitive bidding, as well as specific allocations for all geographic areas, Native American communities, and migrant and seasonal farm workers. Prohibits the use of LSC funds to provide legal assistance with respect to: (1) litigation relating to prison conditions; (2) the defense of an individual in a proceeding to evict him or her from a public housing project in connection with a drug offense; or (3) all but certain aliens. Authorizes the LSC to allow use of a portion of the funds provided under the grant or contract to acquire and develop information technology to promote full access to high-quality, efficient legal representation and materials for self-representation. Allows the use of LSC funds to provide legal assistance with respect to any fee-generating case (which is currently prohibited), but only if the recipient's attorney reports on the representation and the amount of fees awarded. Directs the LSC to require an audit of each recipient in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to enter into grants or contracts with accredited law schools in the states for the purpose of paying up to 90% of the costs of expanding or establishing clinical experience programs in such schools.[/INST]

 The Phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings.  Last night's game was hard fought.  The game in Chicago should have been a blow out.  All in all these two games show a different Phillies team. In past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 1 run games.  I don't know how many times I saw them losing by only 1 run. If they were able to win most of those, they might have been more of a contending team.  They are 3-0 so far in extra innings.  And of course, they are 10-3. [/INST]

     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^  Hopefully EPSN will use the lesson given by the master: Ted Turner. The season Ted introduced TNT, many cable co.'s refused to put it on, saying that, gee we get enough old movies, miniseries, etc. on TBS, USA, AMC, WGN, WOR, why do we need another one? This was in the fall. Come spring, Ted fixed their little red wagons good. The previous spring, NBA playoffs wore on TBS, now they were on TNT (and still are). And everyone gets TNT now.  So, ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN2, and leave hockey on ESPN. And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN in favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between channels every week.  But, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy?[/INST]

I'm not sure if NJ just rose up and  played better or if the Penguins just started to play down  somewhat. Probably it was somewhere in between. New Jersey  seemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end. They  did much more swarming around, which at least kept an  element of suspense in the game. No question that Billington  helped make it more interesting also. Claude Lemieux didn't  help the cause any though, with his ejection early in the  game.

Organization: Temple University X-Newsreader: NNR/VM S_1.3.2  Last week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met this doctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as I arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown. They told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the doctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first time? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but on the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met him with my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was there for and took a history, all before I undressed.   Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor for the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor on something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. If nothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the self conscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of[/INST]

 Not bad. We had a similar situation. Slowpitch softball, bases loaded, weakest hitter at the plate. He hits a line drive over the third baseman's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in foul ground, almost hitting the fence down that side of the field. But the umpire called fair ball! I was coaching third, yelling at evrybody  to move up a base. The ump's position: ""it was still fair when it passed third base"".  Why the other team didn't immediately protest I'll never know; we certainly weren't going to argue about it, since every body did manage to advance one base safely.  There was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner from second base) leg, fielded by the SS, steps on second to force the runner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire called a triple play; protest removed when we won the game anyway.[/INST]

 Bill, I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism. Lack of  belief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding transcendental values. I hope you would accept the fact that  for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism.  I think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might  revise and fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems.  Cheers, Kent [/INST]

 ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the follow-the-puck concept of televising hockey games.

Hi sci.med folks...  I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium.  I have a 10 year old son that lives with my ex-wife.  She has been having difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin, Tofranil, and now wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion.  I would like to  know whatever is important that I should know.  I worry about this sort of thing and would like pros/cons regarding Lithium therapy.  I have a booklet from the ""Lithium Information Center"" based at the  University of Wisconsin, but feel that it is pro-lithium and would be interested in comments from the ""not necessarily PRO"" side of the fence.

  started!"". not   It's also what you say when you're waiting for the end to come in a  ""fiery apocalypse""...just a thought.  Personally, if the fire was set (by either side), I wonder about the timing.  If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything ""new"" that happened just around that point?  Similarly, if the FBI were going to torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't it be more ""reasonable"" to believe the BD's would set the fire early after the assault began?    The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting of the fire by the tanks.  Among other things, I say that because I was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter (watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously. Specifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of the tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been  penetrating[/INST]

American Natural Gas Security and Consumer Protection Act - Amends the Natural Gas Act to prohibit any person from exporting any natural gas from the United States to a foreign country without first having secured an order of the Secretary of Energy (DOE) authorizing such person to do so. Allows the Secretary to issue an order authorizing such exportation, upon application, if the Secretary determines that the proposed exportation will be consistent with the public interest. Requires the Secretary to issue an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 on such an order, including by analyzing the impacts of extraction of exported natural gas on the environment in communities where the natural gas is extracted. Directs the Secretary to issue final regulations for determining whether an export of natural gas from the United States to a foreign country is in the public interest. Exempts any export authorization order from such EIS and public interest requirements if the natural gas would be exported solely to meet certain requirements of: (1) the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (regarding presidential foreign exchange transaction authorities), (2) the Trading with the Enemy Act (regarding such transaction authorities in wartime), or (3) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (regarding the International Energy Program).

      The lethality in small part, but mostly what I found frightening  was the fact that they were wielded by people who believed that they  ate breakfast every morning with Jesus Christ. Now I wasn't there in  Galilee back in the Roman occupation, so I don't know for certain that  David Koresh was not Jesus Christ, but I strongly suspect that he was  not (even aside from the fact of never having seen them in a photograph  together).

Entrepreneurial Businesses Creating Jobs Act of 2015 or the EB-JOBS Act of 2015 This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make conditional permanent resident (EB-6) visas (adjustable to permanent resident after two years) available to qualifying venture capital-backed and self-sponsored startup entrepreneurs based upon specified investment, job creation, and commercial activity requirements. Permanent resident (EB-7) visas shall be made available to nonimmigrant treaty investors holding an E-2 visa who: (1) have maintained such status for at least 10 years, and (2) created full-time employment for at least 5 U.S. workers for at least 10 years. EB-6 and EB-7 visa holders are exempted from worldwide immigration limits. An alien who is eligible to receive an EB-6 or EB-7 visa may adjust to permanent resident status if he or she was present in the United States on the date of the enactment of this Act and has been continuously present since that date. The EB-5 employment creation regional center program is made permanent with a set-aside of at least 5,000 visas. A regional center shall: (1) have jurisdiction over a specific geographic area, which shall be consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones; and (2) certify compliance with U.S. securities laws, and supervise all offers, purchases, and sales of securities made by associated commercial enterprises to ensure securities compliance. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall terminate the designation of any regional center that does not provide such certification on an annual basis. DHS shall deny or revoke the designation of a regional center if the center's program participation presents: (1) a threat to public safety or national security; or (2) a significant risk of criminal misuse, fraud, or abuse. DHS shall: (1) establish a procedure for pre-approval of new commercial enterprises, (2) impose a fee for regional center designation, and (3) perform site visits. Immigrant visa set-asides for job creation in a target employment area are revised to require: at least 2,000 visas for rural areas; at least 4,000 visas for high unemployment areas; and at least 2,000 visas for a county with a 20% or more population decrease since 1970, an area within a state or federal economic development incentive program, or an area within a military installation closed pursuant to a base closure law. Concurrent filing for adjustment of status is authorized for persons applying for EB-5, EB-6, and EB-7 visas. The Immigrant Entrepreneur Account is established in the Treasury to collect from, and use for, the EB-5 and EB-6 programs, together with a premium processing fee. Additional EB-5 visas shall be made available each year in which the annual cap is reached unless a joint resolution of Congress is enacted finding that such an increase is not needed. The J-1 visa waiver (for Conrad state 30/medical services in under served areas) program is made permanent. The E-verify and special immigrant non minister religious worker programs are reauthorized.[/INST]

The Motorist's Bill of Rights: Increasing Gas Supply, Reducing Demand, and Protecting Consumers from Gouging - Makes it unlawful, with specified exceptions, for a supplier to increase the price for road transportation fuel or domestic heating fuel by an unconscionable amount in an area during a period covered by a presidential proclamation that an abnormal market disruption has occurred. States that a violation of this Act shall be: (1) treated as an unfair or deceptive act or practice as defined under the Federal Trade Commission Act; and (2) subject to civil and criminal penalties. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), upon the request of a state governor or tribal organization, to provide financial assistance to hire additional personnel to assist a state or Indian tribe with expertise in fields relevant to consideration of federal refinery authorizations. Requires a federal coordinator, upon the request of an applicant seeking a federal refinery authorization, to establish a memorandum of agreement, executed by relevant federal and state agencies, setting forth the most expeditious coordinated schedule possible for completion of all such authorizations. States that such process of authorizations shall apply to a refinery sited or expanded: (1) in a state or on Indian lands where the process of authorization has been requested; or (2) on a closed military installation. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a public education campaign for U.S. drivers about immediate measures that can be taken to conserve transportation fuel. Amends the Clean Air Act to add as ""extreme and unusual circumstances that prevent the distribution of an adequate supply of fuel or fuel additives to consumers"" under which the Administrator may temporarily waive a control or prohibition on the use of a fuel or fuel additive circumstances that are the result of unexpected problems with equipment necessary for transportation and delivery of fuel or fuel additives. States that EPA shall have no authority, when considering a state implementation plan (SIP) or SIP revision, to approve any fuel included in such plan or revision if the effect of such approval increases the total number of fuels set forth on the published list of approved fuels (currently EPA does not have the authority to approve a fuel if it increases the total number of fuels approved as of September 1, 2004, in all SIPs). Requires notice and opportunity for comment before EPA removes a fuel from the list. Requires EPA to remove a fuel from the list if such fuel has ceased to be included in an SIP or is identical to a federal fuel control or prohibition. Repeals provisions prohibiting EPA from reducing the total number of authorized fuels. Requires EPA to publish a revised list reflecting the reduction in the number of fuels.[/INST]

  Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).  You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the Classic Example, but there are probably others.  Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.  The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:  1: How does it work?  2: What evidence is there?  The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to evaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures. (Always beware the words ""channel"" and ""energy"" in any spiel put out by an alternative practitioner.)  The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is anecdotal[/INST]

Edmonton has been fairly - supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market - team, they had many sellouts in the 80s.

Here we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm team, the Rochester Amerks, on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting? The same Penguins/Devils every other day crap that everyone else gets. What's worse, the SportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out, since we got CBA basketball last night, if you can believe it.  I assume the Sabres are demanding the SC blackout, not ESPN, since we are, unbelievably, usually considered part of the Islanders territory (MSG coverage of the Rangers is blacked out here). This despite being a solid seven hours plus from Long Island.  Does anyone know what GRC is doing, besides putting their satellite dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 8, 10, and 13? Did Empire demand a fortune for the games? What about the games on Fox37 (or whatever number it is there in Buffalo)? Has anyone phoned to complain (besides me)?  George [/INST]

Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015 This bill requires the Department of Treasury to implement and maintain a voluntary prospective reporting system for employers subject to the employer mandate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Employers satisfy the information return requirement if they voluntarily report general information about the health coverage offered to full-time employees. Employers satisfy the employee statement requirement if they provide statements to employees after receiving exchange notification that employee or spouse or dependent enrolled in a qualified health plan or qualified for premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies. The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) permit employers and health insurance issuers that provide minimum essential coverage to submit an information return with names and birth dates of covered dependents if the employer or health insurance issuer does not already collect or maintain their taxpayer identification numbers, and (2) permit electronic delivery of employee statement if employee consented previously to electronic delivery of other notices and does not refuse consent in writing. It directs the Government Accountability Office to: (1) evaluate the exchange notification and appeals processes for employers whose employee or spouse or dependent enrolls in a qualified health plan or qualifies for premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies, and (2) evaluate the prospective reporting system functionality. The legislation permits a health insurance exchange to automatically reenroll an individual into a qualified health plan after annually redetermining the individual's eligibility for premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies.[/INST]

 I really don't want to get into a DidSo-DidNot debate with you.  But this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement.  I did not say,  nor did I imply, that I could predict the future.  You have inferred that my comments meant this, and you have based your rebuttal of my comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in regard to clutch hitting.

I came across the following notice in the Denver Post classified secction this morning (April 26, 1993):  \begin{quote}  NOTICE:  The Denver Post will no longer knowingly accept any advertisement to buy or sell assault weapons.  The Denver Post finds that the use of assault weapons poses a threat to the health, safety, and security of its readers.  \end{quote}  Now I suppose the Post is within its rights to refuse such ads.  However, the second sentence is so noxious, I feel compelled to bring it to the  attention of the t.p.g/c.g readership.    I called the Post classified number (825-2525) and expressed my displeasure.  According to the supervisor I spoke to, the Post was reacting to public complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads.  However, she said the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy.  I  strongly encourage Denver Post readers to call and make their feelings known.[/INST]

 That includes suicides.  Since it has been shown in other countries that suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for doing oneself in (studies include some done/published in Japan, Canada, Austria, Norway), suicides ought not be included in the count.

 Right.  Most definitely.   This may be the root of the confusion...  Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind.  Note that I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand.  Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10 and win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week.  In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population will win 7 or more times.  In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again be 7-time winners.  In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in each of the first two years will win 7 again.  Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three years, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.  Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game? No.[/INST]

Child Nutrition Enhancement Act of 2010 - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to replace the team nutrition network program with the wellness and nutrition network (TWNN) program: a nationwide, multidisciplinary program that promotes healthy eating and physical activity by children and is funded and overseen at the federal level, administered at the state level, and implemented at the local level. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop and carry out a comprehensive, integrated national strategy that coordinates federal, state, and local efforts to promote and support healthy eating, physical activity, and positive behavioral changes. Requires the Secretary to provide grants to states to: (1) establish a comprehensive, integrated, and coordinated wellness and nutrition network in their state; and (2) allocate funding to local educational agencies (LEAs) and other institutions providing services under the child nutrition programs to support child nutrition promotion and education. Requires LEAs and other institutions to use such funds to: (1) implement, assess, or strengthen a local wellness policy established under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act; (2) improve the nutritional quality of meals and snacks served through the child nutrition programs; (3) increase children's acceptance of nutritious meals and snacks; (4) implement federal, state, or other health guidelines; (5) provide children with regular physical activity; or (6) work with public and private organizations to promote and support healthy eating and physical activity.[/INST]

Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act (Sec. 4) This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assess the level of risk posed to the domestic air transportation system by individuals with unescorted access to a secure area of an airport. (Sec. 5) The TSA shall update DHS rules on access controls, considering specified matters. The TSA may encourage the issuance by airport and aircraft operators in a timely manner of free one-time, 24-hour temporary credentials for workers who have reported their credentials missing, but not permanently lost, stolen, or destroyed, until replacement of credentials is necessary. (Sec. 6) The TSA shall issue guidance to airport operators for placing an expiration date on each airport credential issued to a non-U.S. citizen, which shall not exceed the period of time he or she is lawfully authorized to work in the United States. The TSA shall: also issue guidance for transportation security inspectors to review annually the procedures of airport operators and air carriers for applicants seeking unescorted access to any Secure Identification Display Area (SIDA) of an airport; and make available to airport operators and air carriers information on identifying suspicious or fraudulent identification materials. This guidance shall require a comprehensive review of background checks and employment authorization documents issued by the DHS Citizenship and Immigration Services during the review of procedures. (Sec. 7) The TSA shall: revise certain regulations to enhance the eligibility requirements and disqualifying criminal offenses for individuals seeking or having unescorted access to an airport's SIDA; and propose disqualification if the individual was convicted, or found not guilty by reason of insanity, of a disqualifying criminal offense within 15 years before the date of an individual's application, or if the individual was incarcerated for that crime and released within 5 years before that date. The TSA shall ensure existence or development of a waiver process for approving the issuance of credentials for unescorted access to a SIDA for an individual found to be otherwise ineligible for such credentials, but about whom circumstances permit the conclusion the individual poses no terrorism risk or any other risk to aviation security warranting denial of the credential. Both the TSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shall implement fully the FBI's Rap Back service for recurrent criminal history vetting of eligible TSA-regulated populations of individuals with unescorted access to an airport SIDA. (The FBI Rap Back Service notifies authorized agencies of criminal, and, in limited cases, civil activity of individuals that occurs after the initial processing and retention of criminal or civil transactions.) The TSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence shall ensure that the TSA may receive automated, real-time access to additional Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) data and any other terrorism related category codes to improve the TSA credential vetting program. DHS shall authorize direct access for each airport operator to the E-Verify program and the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) automated system to determine the eligibility of individuals seeking unescorted access to an airport SIDA. (Sec. 8) The TSA shall develop performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of security for airport SIDAs. (Sec. 9) The TSA shall also: develop a model and best practices for unescorted access security meeting specified criteria, expand the use of TSA officers and inspectors to conduct physical inspections of airport workers in each airport SIDA and at each SIDA access point, and review airports that have implemented additional airport worker screening or perimeter security. The TSA may conduct a pilot program to test and validate best practices for comprehensive airport worker screening or perimeter security. (Sec. 10) The TSA shall: increase the use of red-team, covert testing of access controls to any secure airport areas; and review for continued relevancy and appropriate updating, consolidation, or revocation of every current security directive addressed to any regulated entity. (Sec. 11) The Government Accountability Office shall assess TSA progress in implementing the requirements of this bill and their effect on aviation security. (Sec. 12) A member of the Aviation Stakeholder Advisory Committee may continue to serve beyond the expiration of his or her term until the TSA appoints a successor.[/INST]

FISA Accountability and Privacy Protection Act of 2013 - Amends the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to repeal on June 1, 2015, procedures outlined under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) regarding the targeting by the United States of non-U.S. persons located outside the United States in order to acquire foreign intelligence information. Amends provisions of FISA, the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, the National Security Act of 1947, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) concerning national security letters to, effective June 1, 2015, make such provisions read as they read on October 25, 2001. Repeals a separate related FCRA provision. Amends FISA to revise requirements for applications for access to business records and other tangible things in counterterrorism investigations to require an applicant to present a statement of facts and circumstances showing reasonable grounds to believe that the records sought are relevant to an investigation. Imposes similar requirements for orders for pen registers and trap and trace devices. Defines and requires ""minimization procedures"" for minimizing the retention and dissemination of information obtained from such records and devices. Revises requirements for obtaining orders to prohibit disclosure of the receipt of a national security letter. Requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or other appropriate agency to notify persons challenging a nondisclosure order if facts supporting such order no longer exist. Amends FISA to eliminate: (1) the requirement that recipients of any order to produce records wait one year before challenging such order or a nondisclosure requirement in court, and (2) the conclusive presumption that disclosure of an order for tangible things would endanger national security or a person's life or safety or would interfere with a criminal or terrorist investigation or with diplomatic relations. Revises procedures for obtaining judicial review of national security letter nondisclosure orders. Allows the recipient of a nondisclosure order to request judicial review of the order and requires the government to respond by setting forth specific facts in a certification that justify the need for nondisclosure based upon national security and other concerns. Requires courts, in considering whether to grant a nondisclosure order, to give substantial weight to the facts alleged by the government in its certification. Modifies the standard for obtaining a national security letter to require the FBI or other agency issuing a national security letter to provide a written statement of specific facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized investigation. Modifies reporting requirements for national security letters to require a breakdown of the types of persons targeted (e.g., U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons) and whether such persons are subjects of authorized national security investigations. Amends FISA to require the Attorney General to submit an annual unclassified report summarizing how the authorities under such Act are used, including the impact of such use on the privacy of U.S. persons. Extends through 2013 provisions requiring the Inspector General of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to conduct audits on investigative authority provided to the FBI under FISA and on the effectiveness and use of national security letters. Repeals a requirement for such audits to include information on bureaucratic or procedural impediments to the use of such letters. Directs the Inspector General to report to Congress on the results of such audits: (1) by January 1, 2014, for audits conducted for 2010 and 2011, and (2) by January 1, 2015, for audits conducted for 2012 and 2013. Requires reports by the inspectors general of each element of DOJ assessing the use and value of information obtained through such investigative authority and national security letters. Sets forth similar audit and reporting requirements regarding the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices and requires submission to the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) as well as Congress. Amends the federal criminal code to reduce from 30 to 7 days the period for giving delayed notice of the execution of a search warrant in a criminal investigation when the warrant permits the giving of such delayed notice. Authorizes the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community to review the acquisition, use, and dissemination of acquired surveillance information in order to review its compliance with adopted targeting and minimization procedures, as well as with guidelines for the protection of privacy rights of U.S. persons. Requires such Inspector General to report to the Attorney General, the DNI, and specified congressional committees on reviews conducted.

Pay It Forward College Affordability Act of 2013 - Direct the Secretary of Education to conduct studies regarding the feasibility of, and options for, implementing the Pay It Forward model for funding postsecondary education. Directs the Secretary, unless the studies determine that the funding model is not feasible or beneficial, to award competitive matching grants to states to establish and carry out Pay It Forward model state pilot programs. Limits the number of states and students that may participate in the programs. Describes the ""Pay It Forward model"" as a system in which the Secretary, a state, or an institution of higher education (IHE) replaces students' need to borrow under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program by covering all or part of their cost of attending an IHE in exchange for their agreement to contribute a certain percentage (not to exceed 5%) of their annual income for a specified number of years (not to exceed 25 years) after graduating or ceasing to be enrolled at the IHE. Requires that model to cover at least a student's cost of tuition and mandatory fees, but only to the extent they do not exceed the cost of tuition and mandatory fees at the most expensive public IHE in the state that is the same type of IHE the student attends. Requires states to give program priority to IHEs that have a plan, or a history of making an effort, to reduce or hold constant students' cost of attendance. Requires states to ensure that variations in the time that a student's tuition and mandatory fees are covered by the state are reflected in the length of the student's contribution period and the percentage of the student's annual income to be contributed. Continues students' eligibility for grants, scholarships, or funds that do not have to be repaid and for student loans that are not Direct loans, but requires the deduction of those amounts from the tuition and mandatory fees that the state would otherwise cover under the Pay It Forward program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a technical advisory council to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding the implementation and evaluation of the Pay It Forward model, and (2) evaluate the model five years and ten years after its implementation. Authorizes the Secretary to expand the Pay It Forward model if doing so: (1) will not increase the federal cost of carrying out federal loan programs under title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, (2) may be accomplished using amounts available for title IV programs, and (3) is in the best interests of students and the United States. Establishes a Pay It Forward Fund in the Treasury into which Pay It Forward contributions are to be deposited. Prohibits an IHE program designed to prepare students for a recognized occupation or profession requiring licensing or other entry pre-conditions from participating in a Pay It Forward program, unless it: fully prepares students to satisfy those entry pre-conditions in the state in which the program is operated and in any state in which the program claims a successful program graduate will be prepared to work in the particular occupation or profession involved; provides timely placement of students in required pre-licensure positions, such as internships or apprenticeships; and meets specialized state accreditation requirements or notifies students if the program has not yet been fully accredited.[/INST]

I watched the final inning of Bosio's no-hitter with several people at work. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles by about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand. Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an error or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether Vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.    -- -------------------------- Phil Brown                | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |[/INST]

Workplace Advancement Act This bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit discharging or retaliating against any employee because such employee has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed comparative compensation information for the purpose of determining whether the employer is compensating an employee in a manner that provides equal pay for equal work. The prohibition does not apply to instances in which an employee who has access to the wage information of other employees as a part of the employee's job functions discloses such wages to an individual who has no access to them, except in response to a charge or complaint or in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action with respect to prohibited sex discrimination, including an investigation conducted by the employer.

Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2016 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to include Indian tribal governments in an annual allocation of a national tax-exempt bond volume cap. The bill repeals provisions that limit an Indian tribal government's eligibility to issue tax-exempt bonds or to be exempt from specified excise taxes to transactions involving the exercise of an essential government function customarily performed by state and local governments. The bill amends the IRC and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to treat employee benefit or pension plans maintained by Indian tribes and domestic relations orders issued pursuant to tribal law in the same manner as plans maintained by states and domestic relations orders issued pursuant to state law. The bill treats tribal charities and foundations in the same manner as charities and foundations funded and controlled by other governmental entities for purposes of the tax-exempt status of, and deduction for contributions to, such organizations. The bill amends the Social Security Act to give Indian tribes or tribal organizations access to the Federal Parent Locator Service if they are eligible for a grant to operate a child support enforcement program. It makes those tribes and tribal organizations eligible to participate in the program that collects past-due support from individual tax refunds. An Indian tribal government may determine whether a child has special needs for the purpose of the tax credit for the adoption of a child with special needs.[/INST]

Drywall Safety Act of 2012 - (Sec. 2) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Commerce should insist that: (1) the government of China, which has ownership interests in the companies that manufactured and exported problematic drywall to the United States, facilitate a meeting between the companies and U.S. government representatives about remedying affected homeowners; and (2) such companies comply with any related U.S. court decisions. (Sec. 3) Requires certain gypsum board labeling standards of ASTM International (formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials), as in effect on the day before the enactment of this Act, to be treated as a rule promulgated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Provides procedures for: (1) ASTM International to notify the CPSC of any subsequent revision of such standards; and (2) the revised standards to become effective unless the CPSC, within a specified period, determines that the revisions do not adequately identify gypsum board by manufacturer and month and year of manufacture. (Sec. 4) Requires the CPSC to promulgate a final rule concerning drywall manufactured or imported for domestic use that limits sulfur content to a level not associated with elevated rates of corrosion in the home. Provides exceptions, and means of enforcement as a rule, if the CPSC determines that a voluntary standard (developed by a specified Subcommittee on Specifications and Test Methods for Gypsum Products of ASTM International) is adequate to permit identification and publishes the determination in the Federal Register. Provides procedures for revision of such voluntary standards. Allows the CPSC, at any time subsequent to publication of such a rule, to initiate a rulemaking to modify the sulfur content limit or include a provision relating only to drywall composition or characteristics that the CPSC determines is reasonably necessary to protect public health or safety. (Sec. 5) Directs the CPSC to revise its ""Remediation Guidance for Homes with Corrosion from Problem Drywall"" to specify that problematic drywall removed pursuant to the guidance should not be reused or used as a component in production of new drywall.[/INST]

 Generally I agree with you. However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball Tonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cut away at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) if ESPN couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to let SportsChannel pick up the slack.  Nonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regular season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S. Support your team; support your game.  Somebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would consider their products. Here's an equally excellent idea, watch baseball for 10 minutes (I know I'm asking a lot, but that's what spew bags are for), write down who is advertising, and write them letters complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and that you won't consider buying their products because of it.[/INST]

   Sure there are quacks. There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly.  There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones.   There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists.   Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who.    Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in Babylon.   Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses aren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue against the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody.   Sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the disease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have something that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been described yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes[/INST]

 I think it was - he went into town fairly often, and was known to go jogging.  This was even during the 9 month period when he was being watched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned according to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting them, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted to have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell...  He was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered peacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully). He has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY.

  Remember me, Tom?  I hope you'll respond, and I seem to be a Voice of Reason or some such (I've been recieving fan mail, so naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late), and hope to make a few points here.    And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting the many?  We say ""no,"" while others say ""yes.""    Can you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it.    Of course.  This is not in contention.

Next Generation High Schools Act This bill requires the Department of Education to award competitive, five-year grants to local educational agencies or charter schools that partner with specified institutions and intermediaries to provide high school students with challenging academic and career-related learning opportunities. Applicants must assure that school improvement funds will be allocated to eligible high schools in amounts that are proportionate to those schools' share of low-income students. ""Eligible high schools"" are those that: (1) serve a population of students of which at least 65% are from low-income families; (2) have a graduation rate at or below 67%, excepting new high schools; (3) do not receive school improvement funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; and (4) are identified by their state as low-performing. Grantees must use grant funds to: develop and implement partnerships to help schools prepare students to apply academic concepts to real world challenges; implement an early warning indicator system in eligible high schools and feeder middle schools to identify struggling students; offer support and credit recovery opportunities for struggling students at the grantee's secondary schools or in other appropriate settings; provide drop-out recovery or re-entry programs; offer evidence-based programs and supports related to the transition from middle school to high school; and provide high school leaders, staff, students, and families with information concerning graduation requirements, postsecondary admission requirements, the availability of financial assistance, labor markets, and other programs and services to improve the prospects of traditionally underserved students.[/INST]

Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay.   Montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is truly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four, perhaps five,  were quite stoppable. [/INST]

Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or a state with an approved National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, from requiring an NPDES permit for a covered vessel for the next two years for any discharge: (1) of effluent from properly functioning marine engines; (2) of laundry, shower, and galley sink wastes; or (3) that is incidental to the normal operation of a covered vessel. Defines ""covered vessel"" to mean a vessel that is less than 79 feet in length or a fishing vessel. Requires the Administrator to evaluate the impacts of such discharges, excluding discharges: (1) from a vessel of the Armed Forces; (2) of sewage from a vessel, other than the discharge of graywater from a vessel operating on the Great Lakes; and (3) of ballast water.

Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act of 2015 This bill authorizes the Department of the Treasury to establish a regional infrastructure accelerator program to provide grants to regional infrastructure accelerators to establish and administer a process for developing the priorities of, and acquiring financing for, covered infrastructure projects. A ""regional infrastructure accelerator"" is defined as a multi-jurisdictional organization dedicated to provide technical assistance, financing options, and resources for covered infrastructure projects within the represented jurisdictions. A ""covered infrastructure project"" is as an infrastructure project sponsored by a state, local, or regional public entity that involves the construction, consolidation, alteration, or repair of rail, bus, or public transportation facilities or equipment, highway facilities (including bridges and tunnels), airports, port or marine facilities and equipment, pipelines, inland waterways, intermodal facilities and equipment, water treatment and solid waste disposal facilities, storm water management systems, dams and levees, and facilities or equipment for energy transmission, distribution, or storage. From applications received, Treasury shall select five regional infrastructure accelerators from geographically diverse regions to receive initial grants. A regional infrastructure accelerator shall use such a grant to: assess regional approaches to advancing innovative investment in covered infrastructure projects; develop strategies for transparency in the analysis of such projects to ensure protection of the public interest, for the bundling of smaller scale and rural projects into a larger transaction for investment, and for reducing transaction costs; facilitate the creation of a catalog of covered infrastructure projects available for investment; and analyze and apply project procurement methods. Treasury shall review reports submitted by such accelerators and select four of them to receive subsequent grants. A selected accelerator may use such subsequent grant to make subgrants to public entities for covered infrastructure predevelopment costs, which may include project planning, feasibility studies, economic assessments, cost-benefit analyses, public benefit studies, design and engineering, financial planning, permitting, environmental review, assessment of the impacts on the area, workforce and wages and benefits, assessment of infrastructure vulnerability and resilience to the impacts of climate change and other risks, and public outreach and community engagement.[/INST]

 Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an interplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person's self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely mental/verbal level, and don't usually find expression in society except in an impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  Sometimes this has to be so.   Also, what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society, in a very real sense?  To use the obvious example, there is a political society, and a racial society, and a gender society, and sometimes they do not always agree on every issue...    Yes.  Perhaps with an infamous ""do what you want so long as it doesn't hurt others?""  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do: it is not a morality in that it doesn't propound any specifically preferred behaviours.   I'll add a hearty ""me two"".  However, one could just as well say just because certain actions are moral does not make them legal: one still doesn't really get an impression[/INST]

Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI's? This is the situation that brought the question up:  The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5-1.  The Mariners had the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the fielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.    Now, without a judgement call (and I don't think there is one), this is an RBI for the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be ""defensive indifference"", since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point.  (I know, I can think of several ""If the Mariners stole third and second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and maybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc... scenarios, too.

Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding the visa waiver program to require that an alien, when applying for program admission, possess a valid unexpired passport that: is machine-readable, tamper-resistant, incorporates document authentication identifiers, and otherwise satisfies the internationally accepted standard for machine readability; and beginning on April 1, 2016, is an electronic passport that is fraud-resistant, contains relevant biographic and biometric information, and satisfies internationally accepted standards for electronic passports. A program country must certify that: it issues passports that satisfy the internationally accepted standard for machine readability, and as of April 1, 2016, passports that satisfy internationally accepted standards for electronic passports; and by October 1, 2016, except for travel between countries within the Schengen Zone (26 European countries that have abolished passport and any other border control at their common borders), it has in place mechanisms to validate such passports at each key port of entry. (Sec. 3) An alien shall be ineligible for program participation who: has been present, at any time on or after March 1, 2011, in Iraq or Syria, in a country designated as one that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, or in any other country or area of concern designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and regardless of whether the alien is a national of a program country, is a national of Iraq or Syria, a country designated as a country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, or any other country or area of concern. Such prohibitions shall not apply to an alien who was present in such a country to perform military or official government service for a program country. DHS may waive such prohibitions if in U.S. law enforcement or national security interests, and shall report annually to Congress on each waiver made in the previous year. DHS shall determine and review annually whether such prohibitions shall apply to any country or area, considering whether: the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that he or she is a credible U.S. security threat, a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area, and the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists. (Sec. 4) A program country shall: report the loss or theft of one of its national's passports to the United States within 24 hours; and except in the case of a country without an international airport, and except for travel between countries within the Schengen Zone, certify to DHS that it is screening each entering or departing non-citizen or non-national for unlawful activity by using Interpol databases and notices, or other means designated by DHS. If DHS and the State Department jointly determine that a program country is not sharing information or conducting required screening, DHS shall terminate the country's program status, subject to specified conditions for reinstatement. (Sec. 5) Certain reporting requirements are amended. (Sec. 6) DHS shall evaluate program countries annually and identify and suspend from program participation any country whose nationals present a high U.S. security risk. In suspending a country DHS shall consider: the number of nationals determined ineligible for U.S. travel during the previous year, the number of nationals identified in U.S. government databases related to the identities of known or suspected terrorists during the previous year, the estimated number of nationals who have traveled to Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011, to engage in terrorism, the country's capacity to combat passport fraud, the level of cooperation with U.S. counter-terrorism efforts, and the adequacy of the country's border and immigration controls. DHS shall give Congress an annual evaluation and threat assessment of each country that presents a high U.S. security risk. (Sec. 7) DHS shall: research opportunities to incorporate anti-fraud/deception technology into the electronic system for travel authorization; and collect from an applicant information on any additional or previous countries of citizenship, and consider such information when making admissions determinations. DHS shall report annually to Congress on: (1) the number of individuals denied travel eligibility under the program or whose travel eligibility was revoked during the previous year, and (2) the number of such individuals who were determined to represent a U.S. security threat. DHS shall report to Congress on steps to strengthen the electronic system for travel authorization. (Sec. 8) DHS shall provide assistance in a risk-based manner to non-program countries to assist them in: submitting theft or loss of passport information to Interpol; and issuing and validating at ports of entry electronic passports that are fraud-resistant, contain relevant biographic and biometric information, and otherwise satisfy internationally accepted standards for electronic passports. (Sec. 9) The electronic travel authorization system is renamed the electronic system for travel authorization. (Sec. 10) It is the sense of Congress that: the International Civil Aviation Organization should establish electronic passport standards and obligate member countries to utilize them as soon as possible, and such passports should be a combined paper and electronic passport that contains biographic and biometric information that can be used to authenticate identity through an embedded chip.[/INST]

Note:  I'm not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard, but as an independent sort of thread.  I do actually quote some things that Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as ""sampling"" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what I want to say.   There's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In the biology context, we would very likely read ""fitness"" for ""the score of the game"" and ""organisms"" for ""teams"".  How we interpret ""players"" is trickier, but either ""organs"", or ""genes"" might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A ""genes"" interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case,  but that would be a different and probably longer post.  If, however, we take the ""organ"" view, then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like ""species X is more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z"".

I would recommend you to take a look at  1) your dictionary 2) alt.atheism FAQ files  to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_. I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without paying careful attention to this issue.    IMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although I'm sure the replies might keep you amused for hours.   No, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual philosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life, the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could hardly be called a philosophical system.

Border Tax Equity Act of 2016 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on imports from any foreign country that: (1) employs an indirect tax system, and (2) grants rebates of indirect taxes paid on exports from that country. This tax shall be collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and deposited into a special account. The bill also amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the CBP, upon request of a U.S. exporter, to pay to the exporter from this special account an amount equal to the amount of indirect taxes imposed by the importing foreign country, minus any U.S. taxes rebated or funded upon exportation. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative must report on specified matters related to World Trade Organization negotiations, border taxes, and free-trade agreements.[/INST]

I am writing this to find out the following:  1.) Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis.  2.) The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery.  3.) Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer.  My boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with  reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he  saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta,  Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.   These treatments were not effective and because the damage was  worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told  there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen  wrap and a ""Hill Repair"".  He opted for the ""Hill Repair"". He recovered  very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse  and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).  The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him  that a biopsy might be necessary if he has[/INST]

 I too think that Joseph has had a GREAT year and should be considered for the Vezina.  I think Barrasso and Joseph should be the two strongest candidates this year.  I don't believe ALL of the hype that Roy, Belfour and now Potvin receive for their goaltending.  I do think that they are great in the nets, but I would rather have Curtis, Tommy or Fuhr in the nets during this years playoffs.  The big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front of them and the goaltenders get the most credit.  I would rather face 25 shots a game, than have to rely on Joseph saving 35, but if the goalie is going to face 35 shots, I would rather have Joseph or Barrasso facing them.  -Jay  ps Go Quebec!!!

 I've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery, and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme.  Ordinary massage is intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular or joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners who take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be quack science to justify their technique.  In the case of massage, there is a technique called ""deep abdominal massage"" in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines! The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the intestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease syndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.[/INST]

Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2011 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, for application of quality standards for certain accredited suppliers of prosthetic devices, orthotics, and certain prosthetics, to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to designate and approve an independent accreditation organization with respect to such suppliers only if that organization is the American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics, Inc. or the Board for Orthotist/ Prosthetist Certification (or a program with essentially equivalent accreditation and approval standards). Exempts from such standards any suppliers who: (1) are physicians, occupational therapists, or physical therapists licensed or otherwise regulated by the state in which they practice; and (2) receive Medicare payments. Applies to custom-fitted orthotics the special payment rules for certain prosthetics and customfabricated orthotics. Modifies the Medicare payment rules for orthotics and prosthetics to account for practitioner qualifications and complexity of care. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on: (1) HHS steps taken to ensure that the state licensure and accreditation requirements are enforced, and (2) the effects of requirements of this Act on the occurrence of Medicare fraud and abuse with respect to orthotics and prosthetics. Requires the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to submit to Congress a projection of the effect on cumulative federal spending under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) for 2012-2016 that will result from implementation of this Act. Requires the Secretary, if the Chief Actuary projects that implementation of this Act will not result in a cumulative spending reduction of at least $250 million for 2012-2016, to issue an interim final regulation to strengthen the licensure, accreditation, and quality standards applicable to orthotics and prosthetics suppliers in order to produce such a cumulative reduction by the end of 2016.

Employee Misclassification Prevention Act - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to require every employer to: (1) keep records of non-employees (contractors) who perform labor or services (except substitute work) for remuneration; and (2) provide certain notice to each employee and non-employee, including their classification as an employee or non-employee and information concerning their rights under the law. Makes it unlawful for any person to fail to accurately classify an employee or non-employee. Doubles the amount of liquidated damages for maximum hours, minimum wage, and notice of classification violations by an employer. Subjects a person who repeatedly or willfully violates such notice requirements to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each violation.

    Another pair of suggestions:    1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay ""safe""       no matter what the pitcher does.     2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)       without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base       as if walked.  This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably.  Suppose the pitcher uses up (N-1) of his N pick-off attempts.  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base, given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it right this time.  Would this suggestion apply to pick-off attempts per pitch, per batter, or per base runner (on the same base)?   -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dr. Edward J.

 From a parallel thread.  Much about definitions of bombs, etc. deleted. [...]   Mathew, I agree.  This, it seems, is the crux of your whole position, isn't it?  That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him arms to fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those who did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and it's a done deal. Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say, ""Well, we sold him all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad for Kuwait.""  No, unfortunately, sitting back and ""letting things be"" is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein's military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with your statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to sell arms to Hussein.  So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor so much, it was the U.S.'s and the West's shortsightedness in selling arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable, right?  If so, then I agree.

  Matt's problem is really more ability than attitude.  It isn't that he's got it in his mind that he wants to swing away, but rather that he's (still) a total sucker for the curve ball.  It looked for a while in 1990 that he was getting better but it's still his weak point.  As to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him, the  net.stat.mavens will probably tell you there's no reason that it should, but if he thinks it will, it might be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  As to whether the Giants' lineup is optimal:  who knows?  Batting Bonds, the team's best hitter, fifth does seem to be odd, but the #1 and #2 hitters aren't exactly Messrs. OBA, so they aren't giving much up there.  And although Clark isn't the overall offensive force that Bonds is, he seems better suited to the #3 spot.  Assuming, of course, that he starts hitting one of these days... [/INST]

Cardinals for poor  Without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war, I would like to question the notion that ""sitting a rested player down"" has any real effect on his long-term performance.  Sure, if a man is tired and needs real rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act.  Perhaps if a man is mentally ""strained"", then sitting him down might help to the extent that that helps him relax.

And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other games because its feature game was over?  Sound familiar?  This year I'm getting twice the coverage.

Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts a long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don't like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going on in that game.  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or pitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow walk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason (Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of reach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).    I want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoy watching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much dead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch it on television, because they're busy showing you replays).

I knew, despite the lack of a full game telecast last week, it was still too much hockey for Atlanta. Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any playoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16, they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this is still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but it is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.   I asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was not that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time without much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs. She told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf was shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come contractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She then couldn't give me a coherent answer. [/INST]

I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls off a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficult to fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired.  Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound.  Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex. Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate[/INST]

  Not when the power has been cut off for weeks on end.  Any generators are no doubt out of fuel, too.  So all they would have is wood stoves and kerosene lanters (maybe).  It is alleged that the tanks pushing in the walls knocked over the lanters, starting the fire.

 Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. B12 deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia), yet I sill hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine:  candida can cause mucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients, systemic candida infection.  I think ""The Yeast Connection"" is a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well nutrition is taught, anyway?  Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds,  depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.  [/INST]

 Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're used on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions, relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.  Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual hangover or ""drugged"" feeling the next morning. [/INST]

[stuff deleted]  I agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific argument.  That ""has great hands"" means nothing.  It seems to me that a first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily) from his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  How many such chances does he get during a game?  Many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is much higher than Grounder/Popup totals).  This implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line or in the dirt.  ""Good Hands"" are needed for such plays, and thus have value.  I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays, but I'd guess that the values of these abilities are similar.  It's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose).[/INST]

Secure Water Facilities Act - Secure Drinking Water Facilities Act - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to revise and expand requirements for assessment by covered water systems of their vulnerability to a range of intentional acts. Defines a ""covered water system"" as a public water system that serves a population of more than 3,300 individuals or that presents a security risk that requires regulation. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to establish: (1) increasingly stringent, risk-based performance standards for the security of such systems; (2) requirements and deadlines for systems to conduct and update assessments, develop and revise security plans and emergency response plans, and provide training to system and contractor employees; and (3) four risk-based tiers for the categorization of systems. Requires the Administrator to assign each system to such tiers. Authorizes the Administrator to designate any chemical substance as a substance of concern and establish the threshold quantity for the release or theft of each such substance. Requires the Administrator to: (1) provide baseline information to systems regarding the types of intentional acts that constitute probable threats, (2) direct systems that possess substances of concern in excess of the release threshold quantity to include in their site security plans assessments of methods to reduce the consequences of chemical releases from intentional acts, (3) determine whether to require systems to implement such methods, (4) develop non-binding guidance to assist systems in assessing and implementing methods to reduce consequences of a chemical release by reducing or eliminating reliance on the use of threshold quantities of such substances, and (5) prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of protected information. Authorizes the Administrator to provide grants to assist states and systems in complying with this Act and to provide for security-related training of system employees and training for emergency response providers. Authorizes appropriations for FY2013-FY2017. Secure Wastewater Treatment Facilities Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to establish the same requirements and set forth analogous provisions with respect to covered treatment works. Defines a ""covered treatment works"" as a treatment works that has a treatment capacity of no less than 2.5 million gallons per day or that presents a security risk that requires regulation.[/INST]

 Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese which all have MSG in them.  It occurs naturally.  I'm not going to quit eating something that I like just because it *might* cause me trouble later or causes problems in *some* people.  I would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting reports of what is good/bad for you.  I may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for me. Fine.  I've made my decision and I don't think it's appropriate for anyone to try to 'convert' me.  ""It's for your own good"" are the most obnoxious and harmful words, IMO, in the English (or any other) language.   I think it is.  I get tired of people saying 'don't eat X because it's BAD!'

Just some thoughts:  I don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player, but this time I couldn't resist.  During the Pens-Devils game last night, second period, I think Kevin Stevens was in the penalty box, Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face, then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself!  All Kjell could do, at 8'7"" and 355 pounds, was laugh!  And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a little out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat.  I've always supported the argument ""he does his job by being irritating,"" but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course, Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either. It seems that he was following the ""The only way to beat the Penguins is to injure them"" philosophy.

 I decided to come back and amend this so it quotes me and has added comments...         before you had a pat of butter, now you need a medium apple (probably microwave the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them. Third, your body, like most peoples, wasn't bred to live on a high fat, modern diet. If you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about the luxury of eating fat, how people enjoyed it. This was because it was so rare. Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that they do now.       are pregnant. If you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the baby. (It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest of the population, a good part of it is that they are willing to do the dieting, etc that helps them avoid surgery. Also, I don't think the surgery lets a person go back to eating a high fat diet. )   [/INST]

Restore America Act of 2011 - Deems the Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010-2015 to have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior as a final oil and gas leasing program in full compliance with specified environmental and other applicable laws. Directs the Secretary to conduct a lease sale every 270 days in each OCS area for which the Secretary determinates there is a commercial interest in purchasing federal oil and gas leases for production on the OCS (OCS Planning Area). Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to: (1) provide for the sharing of of OCS receipts from the leasing of tracts within a specified number of miles of a state coastline; (2) direct the Secretary to include, in each 5-Year Program, lease sale proposals for at least 75% of the available unleased acreage within each OCS Planning Area; and (3) require coordination with adjacent states for pipeline construction for crude oil, petroleum products, and natural gas. Prohibits, on either federal OCS or state waters, uses that are incompatible with: (1) oil and gas leasing, and (2) full oil or natural gas exploration and production on tracts that are geologically prospective for oil and/or natural gas. Requires the Secretary to accept, in satisfaction of mitigation requirements, proposals for mitigation measures on a site away from the area impacted by exploration and production activities. Directs the Secretary to establish and implement a competitive oil and gas leasing program for the exploration, development, and production of the oil and gas resources on the Coastal Plain of Alaska. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to repeal the prohibition against leasing or other development leading to production of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Authorizes the Secretary to designate up to 45,000 acres of the Coastal Plain as a Special Area, after consultation with the state of Alaska, the city of Kaktovik, and the North Slope Borough. Prescribes procedures, terms, and conditions for Coastal Plain lease sales,, including regarding: (1) environmental protection, (2) federal and state distribution of revenues, (3) rights-of-way, and (4) local government impact aid and community service assistance. Sets forth: (1) a ""no significant adverse effect"" standard to govern Coastal Plain activities, and (2) guidelines for expedited judicial review of complaints. Establishes in the Treasury the Coastal Plain Local Government Impact Aid Assistance Fund. Authorizes the Secretary to use amounts in such Fund to provide timely financial assistance to Alaska communities that are directly impacted by oil and gas exploration or production on the Coastal Plain and to establish a coordination office by the North Slope Borough in Kaktovik. Requires the Secretary to hold a lease sale to offer an additional 10 parcels for lease for research, development, and demonstration of oil shale resources. Authorizes the Secretary to temporarily reduce royalties, fees, rentals, bonus bids, or other payments for leases of federal lands for the development and production of oil shale resources. Repeals the limitation on the authority of a federal agency to contract for the procurement of alternative or synthetic fuels under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to: (1) issue operating permits for 200 new commercial nuclear reactors by 2040, and (2) establish and implement an expedited procedure for issuing a combined construction and operating license for nuclear reactors. Authorizes the NRC to provide an applicant for a nuclear reactor license a provisional certification of a proposed nuclear reactor design. Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to abolish the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. Requires the federal government to site and permit at least one radiological material geologic repository for the disposal of radiological material. Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to: (1) report to Congress on the feasibility of establishing an independent radiological material management program, and (2) conduct an inventory of all DOE materials that could be used to power commercial nuclear reactors. Prohibits the President from blocking or hindering spent nuclear fuel recycling activities. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from preventing uranium mining on federal lands unless the Secretary makes findings explaining the reason for such prevention. Revises provisions relating to congressional review of agency rulemaking to require congressional approval of major rules before they may take effect. Revises the definition of ""major rule"" (generally a rule that is likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more) to include an interim final rule. Permits a major rule to take effect for one 90-day calendar period without such approval if the President determines such rule is necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency, for the enforcement of criminal laws, for national security, or to implement an international trade agreement. Sets forth House and Senate procedures for enacting joint resolutions approving major rules and disapproving non-major rules. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) reduce the maximum corporate income tax rate to 25% on taxable income exceeding $50,000, and (2) allow a permanent $500,000 expensing allowance for depreciable business assets.

  There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to ""spot reduce"" body fat other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like ""fat"", so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the ""fat"" is ""changing"" into ""muscle"", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate, and one does not ever ""change into"" the other.

 While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart, it is far from a ""no-brainer"".  The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the best player in the league.

   No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper, and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar.   Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly Kisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.

Subject sez it...  Wondering if either team are in town that weekend (5-30/5-31).  I can probably get Phillies tix, as the Vet can hold a bunch (and I hope they're still in 1st but it's late may, and...).

 Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read  ""The Yeast Connection"".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing  by this ""hated"" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me? Elisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition. A book that you should be familiar with and not ""hate"". ""Candida species  colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly  thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.   Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic  mycosis.""  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic  infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or  ""sick"" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent  parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis. Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute  it.  What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic  infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation (GI tract, mouth,[/INST]

The burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence of this ""syndrome"".  To date, these claims are unsubstantiated by any available data.  Hopefully, as a scientist, you would take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based upon their data.  Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than ""Aunt Susie's brother-in-law ..."".  Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis, but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.  And unlike mathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical issues, and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease.  I would characterize it not as 'abject disbelief' but rather  'scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions'.  I have no problem with such an approach; but this is NOT what is happening in the 'trenches' of this diagnosis.[/INST]

 I've mentioned this study a couple of times now: Ingestion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal vaginitis, Annals of Internal Medicine, 3/1/92 116(5):353-7.  Do you have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than capsules of lactobacillus (even though it had positive results)?  The study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of yogurt.  There was a marked decrease in infections while women were ingesting the yogurt.  Problems with the study included very small numbers (33 patients enrolled) and many protocol violations (only 21 patients were analyzed).  Still, the difference in rates of infection between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly believable.[/INST]

It was a classy move.  But it looks like ESPN is going to devote most of the coverage to the Pens.  On Tuesday night, they continued to broadcast the Pen-Devil game even though Pittsburgh had the game well in control. Granted they did show some ""bonus"" coverage of the Caps and Isles but they cut away from the close game, which went into double ot, to update us on the fifth goal of the rout. Thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between the pens and devils.  IMHO they should program some variety into the telecasts.(Yes I know the game shown on saturday is between the B's and Sabres, probably throwing a bone to us Bruin fans.)

To Rob and all others that have been debating about the wood stove.    The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the  building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responed with why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit  for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims  that it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumped into the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either bought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours. I don't know if you have ever been around CS, but I have.  Being exposed to CS gas was part of my Army training, so I know that without a mask it VERY  uncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in  the stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less  eat.  So my question now is ""why were they cooking food?""[/INST]

 Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus.

The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative  anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a  chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).

I remember that Terry's first year was the first year that the Caps finally made it to the third round but before under Brian, I noticed that every other year the Caps got to the second round and the years in between they didn't make it past the first round. Is this trend continuning?  The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan. P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders!

Job Creation and Urban Revitalization Act of 2011 - Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to expand the new markets venture capital program (currently, a program under which venture capital companies provide equity capital investments and operational assistance to small businesses in low-income geographic areas) to areas of high unemployment. Allows the operational assistance that companies provide to small businesses in such high-unemployment areas to include retooling, updating, or replacing of machinery or equipment.

Requires the SBA Administrator, in conditionally approving companies to participate in the program, to select at least one company from each SBA geographic region. Directs the Administrator to allow conditionally-approved companies two years (currently, a period of time not to exceed two years) to satisfy capital and other requirements for final approval. Exempts from a requirement that conditionally-approved companies have certain binding capital commitments in order to provide operational assistance, companies primarily serving small businesses in areas of: (1) high unemployment, or (2) urban manufacturing revitalization. Authorizes the Administrator to approve a company to serve, throughout all states, solely small businesses in urban manufacturing revitalization areas. Reduces to $3 million the minimum capital requirements for final approval of conditionally-approved companies engaged primarily in development of and investment in small businesses located in areas of high unemployment. Reduces to $2 million such capital requirements for conditionally-approved companies so engaged primarily with small businesses in urban manufacturing revitalization areas. (Current law would otherwise require any conditionally-approved company to raise at least $5 million.) Revises the formula for operational assistance grants. Authorizes such grants to conditionally-approved companies (up to $50,000 per company), provided that repayment is made if such companies do not receive final approval.[/INST]

(This is a cross post to rec.gardens and sci.med. Set the follow-up (line in the header, depending on what kind of advice you give, or (e-mail directly to me: ceci@lysator.liu.se.)  I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice on how to repel wasps.     This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care of them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we couldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie for the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants, I want to be able to spend time[/INST]

Putting aside our substantial differences, I'd like to ask the knowledgeable ones to give feedback on this.  Let me explain.  One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old). Otherwise, she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scans.  She then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered in her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot is in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believe the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked until four years ago).  Anyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are the chances for full remission/recovery?  Thanks.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.[/INST]

Steps Toward Access and Reform Act of 2013 or STAR Act of 2013 - Limits the commencement of a health care lawsuit, except in certain cases including fraud or intentional concealment, to three years after the date of manifestation of injury or one year after the claimant discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. Limits to $250,000 the amount of noneconomic damages in such a lawsuit, but allows a claim for the full amount of any economic damages. Requires the court, in any health care lawsuit, to supervise the arrangements for payment of damages to protect against conflicts of interest that may have the effect of reducing the amount of damages awarded that are actually paid to claimants. Allows any party in any health care lawsuit involving injury or wrongful death to introduce evidence of collateral source benefits. Specifies criteria for the award of punitive damages, limited to the greater of $250,000 or double the amount of economic damages. Preempts state law with respect to health care lawsuits, but subjects to otherwise applicable state or federal law any issue not governed by this Act or any law (including state standards of negligence) established by or under it. Declares the sense of Congress that a health insurer should be liable for damages for harm caused when it makes a decision as to what care is medically necessary and appropriate. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to contract with eligible health professionals to serve for a period of at least four years as a primary care provider in a medically underserved community, in consideration for which the Secretary shall pay up to $100,000 on the principal and interest on the individual's graduate medical, osteopathic, or other health professional educational loans. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a bad debt deduction from gross income for worthless qualified medical care debt of at least 75% of a tax-paying medical care provider's charge for such care. Prohibits the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from taking action to prevent an individual not in the business of importing a prescription drug from importing one from Canada that complies with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Amends the Public Health Service Act to declare that the laws of the state designated by a health insurance issuer (primary state) shall apply to individual health insurance coverage offered by that issuer in the primary state and in any other state (secondary state), but only if the coverage and issuer comply with conditions of this Act. Prohibits a health insurance issuer from offering, selling, or issuing individual health insurance coverage in a secondary state if its insurance commissioner does not use a risk-based capital formula for determining capital and surplus requirements for all health insurance issuers.[/INST]

    [stuff deleted]    The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively, embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the  playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the Norris).  It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before  Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*-- tougher division than the Norris, also known as the ""Snorris"", division. Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such  powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.

 DJ was a popular player in San Diego, Derek Bell was not faring well in the clubhouse at Toronto, so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it was a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry. No statistic can describe it (sorry statheads) and since there are so many new faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it.  (Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v. Clemens WS Ring string)  Yet at first I was sad to see Derek go, still anticipating all of the talent they raved about at the beginning of last season.  I'm glad to see him faring well for the Padres though. [/INST]

  Lots of debate about the virtues of Bryan Murray vs Pat Quinn as a GM deleted.  Randy Graca seems to think Murray is the best GM in the league. I think Quinn is one of several who are better.   When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they  regularily missed the playoffs.  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did.  Quinn has improved the team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender.  When Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup contender.  So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM. Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.[/INST]

   Cute characterization Bill; however, there is no inconsistency between  the two statements.  Even if one believes that religion is ""primitive,  simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish"", one can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of complexity to the explanation.  The ideas themselves don't have to be complex before being excised by Occam's Razor, they only have to add  unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description.   I think the non-essential part of an explanatory system is one that adds no predictive capability to the system.   Huh?   ^^^^^ Watch it, your Freudian Slip is showing [/INST]

 EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove  calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such  use).  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung  disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also  binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when  EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that  were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove  calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C  and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra  vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium  from the plaques).  The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably  can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns  with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.   1. ""Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A[/INST]

To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a  contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current  heights.  You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 again at any time during this year.  Then you must predict either:  (1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or  (2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.  So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as ""13-13"" (resend it if you  were serious, Val!).  ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was in 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place.  So email me your guess, either at ""barring@cs.washington.edu"" or directly replying to this post.  Entries close 5 pm PDT on Wed 28 Apr 1993.[/INST]

 Yes and No. ESPN2 will be launched as early in September. Cap Cities are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service.  The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in the merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks. Prime SportsChannel will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season. Also,TCI and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the country with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the NHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC and ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports contracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams.[/INST]

I don't actually have the answer to this one.  Bosio, after walking the first two batters, retired 27-straight for a ""back-end"" perfect game.  How many other games - including extra inning games - have seen a pitcher retire 27 straight, excluding official perfect games?  The only other instance of this I know about for sure is the famous Ernie Shore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in Cooperstown. Shore came into the game when Boston Pitcher Babe Ruth got thrown out for arguing over the first-batter walk; Shore picked him off and retired 26 straight after that.

  A ""reasonable"" umpire would have recognized that Ron Gant was  disturbed with the call.  A ""reasonable"" umpire would have realized that there was a 1-run game in progress, with two outs in the ninth.  What Ron Gant did was try to regain his composure.  What a ""normal"" baseball player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument with the umpire, and since you can't argue balls and strikes, he would have been ejected from the game.  Ron Gant, by trying to avoid such a conflict, was penalized for showing some restraint.   Incidentally, a ""reasonable"" home plate umpire would not have been so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire, as Gant requested.  If the home plate umpire had appealed to first, the first base umpire could have wrung up the strike, and Gant would not have been so upset.

Requires two annual reports from the Secretary to the defense and appropriations committees on DOD plans to correct the problem, and progress toward achievement of such plan. (Sec. 233) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is in the U.S. national security interest to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with Russia that would enhance the security of the United States, its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies, and Russia, particularly against missile threats from Iran; (2) the United States should pursue ballistic missile defense cooperation with Russia on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis with its NATO allies, particularly through the NATO-Russia Council; (3) missile defense cooperation with Russia should not in any way limit U.S. or NATO missile defense capabilities and should be mutually beneficial and reciprocal in nature; and (4) the United States should pursue appropriate missile defense cooperation with Russia. Requires a report from the President to the defense, appropriations, and foreign relations committees on the status of efforts to reach agreement with Russia on missile defense cooperation.

  Well, the ""jettison for youth fast"" strategy was his. Also in hindsight, it didn't work all that well, but I think it was more because it left the Sharks on a tightrope without a net, not that it was inherently flawed. It was the injuries that caused us to fall.   From all indications, it wasn't the ""major"" factor, but the ""last straw"". There were personality conflicts among Shark management, and disagreements over how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded vs. kept, but who was being sent to KC. What Ferriera did, if rumors are right, was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed).   I think if they'd kept Ferriera, they would have lost some of their other management staff. Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost Grillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep those three.

Taxpayer Bailout Protection Act This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure that payments to plans do not exceed payments to HHS under the risk corridors program (under which a qualified health plan is required to participate in a payment adjustment system based on the ratio of the allowable costs of the plan to the plan's aggregate premiums) for a plan year. HHS must proportionately decrease payments to plans in order to ensure that this requirement is satisfied each year.[/INST]

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book ""Colon Cleansing for Health and Longevity"" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics, along with certain orally ingested ""debris-loosening agents"", boosts the immune system to a significant degree.  He also plugs a unique appliance called the ""Colema Board"", which facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over $100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash, supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its bulkiness.  If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very interested to hear about research and personal experience.  This article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon fasting and cleansing through a ""ritual"" system of purification.  -- Eli [/INST]

  I disagree.  In the end, the *individual* is responsible for his/her own irrationality.  The individual's belief in some dogmatic religion is a  symptom of that irrationality.   Atheists and agnostics, I would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  An atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy of religion as a Christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists among the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore, the conflict between one's religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher must not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may be non-religious was a secondary point.    As opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.  Science does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma: skepticism.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  There is that  wonderful little creature known as the ""theory.""  Many of us believe in the theory of evolution.  We have no absolute proof that this  theory is true, so why do we believe it?  Because it ""makes more  sense than...?""  There is quite a[/INST]

Military Skills to Careers Act - Requires a state, as a condition for receipt of a grant or contract from the Department of Labor to employ disabled veterans' outreach program specialists and local veterans' employment representatives, to establish a program under which that state administers an examination and issues a license or credential to a veteran without requiring any training or apprenticeship if such veteran: (1) receives a satisfactory score on such examination, (2) has been awarded a military occupational specialty that is substantially equivalent to or exceeds the state requirements for such license or credential, (3) has engaged in active practice of such occupation for at least two of the five years preceding the date of application for such license or credential, and (4) pays any fees required by the state for such license or credential. Requires the state to report annually to the Secretary of Labor on the exams administered, the number of veterans who completed such exams, and exam results, disaggregated by occupational field. Allows the Secretary to waive the requirement that a state establish such a program if the state certifies that it: (1) takes into account previous military training or testing; (2) permits veterans to satisfy through examination training or testing requirements for which a veteran has previously completed military training; and (3) substantially reduces training time, based on the military training received by a veteran, required to satisfy requirements the veteran is unable to completely satisfy through examination. Requires an annual report from the Secretary to Congress and the Secretary of Defense on administered exams and exam results.[/INST]

For those who didn't figure it out, the below message was a reply to another in sci.crypt, for which the poster put t.p.g. in the Followup-To line. I didn't notice that. Apologies to those who were confused.  The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages.  However, I don't wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yet another rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that I disagree both with the interpretation of ""well-regulated"" in the Second Amendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion of the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and my reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control, and disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter a special interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference in which ""well regulated"" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', and not under control/disciplined, etc.  Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not an 'arming everyone' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know many do) and little would be served by[/INST]

Sunshine in Litigation Act of 2014 - Amends the federal judicial code to prohibit a court, in any civil action in which the pleadings state facts relevant to protecting public health or safety, from entering an order restricting the disclosure of information obtained through discovery, approving a settlement agreement that would restrict such disclosure, or restricting access to court records, subject to exceptions, unless the court has first made independent findings of fact that: (1) the order would not restrict the disclosure of information relevant to the protection of public health or safety or (2) the public interest in the disclosure of past, present, or potential health or safety hazards is outweighed by a specific and substantial interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the information and the requested protective order is no broader than necessary to protect the confidentiality interest asserted. Prohibits a court from approving any party's stipulation or request to stipulate to an order that would violate this Act. Prohibits such a court from: (1) approving or enforcing any provision of an agreement between or among parties, or an order entered under this Act, to the extent that it restricts a party from disclosing information to any federal or state agency with authority to enforce laws regulating an activity relating to such information (requires such information disclosed to a federal or state agency to be confidential to the extent provided by law); or (2) enforcing any provision of a settlement agreement described under this Act between or among parties to such civil action that prohibits a party from disclosing that a settlement was reached or the terms of the settlement, other than the amount paid, or from discussing the civil action, or evidence produced in it, that involves matters relevant to the protection of public health or safety. Excepts from this enforcement prohibition (thus allowing enforcement of) a settlement agreement provision about which the court finds that the public interest in the disclosure of past, present, or potential health or safety hazards is outweighed by a specific and substantial interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the information or records in question and that the requested protective order is no broader than necessary to protect the confidentiality interest asserted. Creates a rebuttable presumption that the interest in protecting personally identifiable information relating to an individual's financial, health, or other similar information outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to permit, require, or authorize the disclosure of, and no court shall be prohibited from restricting disclosure of or access to: (1) information classified under a secret Executive order concerning national defense or foreign policy, or (2) intelligence sources and methods. Bars this Act from providing a basis for: (1) granting a motion to reconsider, modify, amend, or vacate a protective or settlement order entered before the effective date of this Act; or (2) reversing such an order retroactively on appeal.[/INST]

End Purchase of Firearms by Dangerous Individuals Act of 2015 This bill requires each state to establish a reporting system through which mental health professionals may report information about an individual committed to a mental institution who poses a danger to himself/herself or others or an individual who communicates a serious threat of physical violence against another individual. The legislation requires states to provide mental health records to the National Instant Criminal History Background Check System (NICS) for use in determining whether a person is disqualified from possessing or receiving a firearm. It sets forth provisions to ensure maintenance and removal of records, inclusion of an appeals process, and re-evaluation of disqualifications for individuals under age 18. The bill also requires states to establish a process related to temporary involuntary commitment of individuals at mental health facilities. The Department of Justice (DOJ) must report annually to Congress on states' progress implementing the reporting systems. The bill authorizes DOJ to reduce a state's formula grant allocation under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Program for failing to comply. It directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish guidelines for state reporting systems and state processes regarding temporary involuntary commitment. HHS must also establish a process to certify state compliance. The bill amends the federal criminal code to expand the prohibition against selling firearms or ammunition to persons committed to any mental institution to include persons who communicate to a mental health professional a serious threat to commit an act of violence. Miscellaneous provisions clarify the treatment of individuals temporarily involuntarily committed by a state process, limit civil liability for mental health professionals who fail to report, establish criteria for determining dangerousness, and require a comprehensive study of state statutes that require mental health professionals to directly report certain individuals into state firearm prohibition databases. The bill replaces various statutory references to persons adjudicated as a ""mental defective"" with persons adjudicated as ""ineligible due to disqualifying mental status.""[/INST]

Tax Refund Theft Prevention Act of 2014 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) establish a safe harbor rule for errors on tax information and payee statements to treat such statements as correctly filed if there are one or more errors on such statements and no single erroneous amount differs from the correct amount by more than $25; (2) require any tax return that is prepared electronically, but is printed and filed on paper, to bear a code which can, when scanned, convert such return to an electronic format; (3) impose a fine and/or prison term on any person who willfully misappropriates another person's taxpayer identity; (4) require a tax statement reporting wages and other tax information to show an identifying number for the employee (currently, requires the employee's social security number); (5) increase civil and criminal penalties for tax return preparers who improperly disclose or use tax return information; (6) enhance requirements relating to electronic filing of tax returns and the filing of W-2 and 1099 forms; and (7) impose a due diligence requirement on tax return preparers to verify the identity of a taxpayer for whom they file a return or refund claim. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) make available on a website resources and guidance that will allow taxpayers to prepare and file (in batches of not more than 50) forms 1099, prepare forms 1099 for distribution to recipients other than the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and create and maintain necessary taxpayer records; (2) establish a single point of contact with an IRS employee for taxpayers whose tax returns have been delayed or affected due to misappropriation of the taxpayer's identity; (3) implement a password system for the prevention of identity theft tax fraud; (4) issue regulations that restrict the delivery or deposit of multiple individual income tax refunds from the same tax year to the same individual account or mailing address; and (5) report on the extent and nature of fraud involving the use of misappropriated taxpayer identity. Grants the Secretary access to information in the National Directory of New Hires for the sole purpose of identifying and preventing fraudulent tax return filings and claims for tax refunds. Amends the federal criminal code to include within the definition of aggravated identity theft the misappropriation of taxpayer identity in connection with tax fraud.[/INST]

Surveillance State Repeal Act - Repeals the USA PATRIOT Act and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (thereby restoring or reviving provisions amended or repealed by such Acts as if such Acts had not been enacted), except with respect to reports to Congress regarding court orders under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) and the acquisition of intelligence information concerning an entity not substantially composed of U.S. persons that is engaged in the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Extends from 7 to 10 years the maximum term of FISA judges. Makes such judges eligible for redesignation. Permits FISA courts to appoint special masters to advise on technical issues raised during proceedings. Requires orders approving certain electronic surveillance to direct that, upon request of the applicant, any person or entity must furnish all information, facilities, or technical assistance necessary to accomplish such surveillance in a manner to protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference with the services that such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person is providing the target of such surveillance (thereby retaining the ability to conduct surveillance on such targets regardless of the type of communications methods or devices being used by the subject of the surveillance). Prohibits information relating to a U.S. person from being acquired pursuant to FISA without a valid warrant based on probable cause. Prohibits the federal government from requiring manufacturers of electronic devices and related software to build in mechanisms allowing the federal government to bypass encryption or privacy technology. Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to report annually on the federal government's compliance with FISA. Permits an employee of or contractor to an element of the intelligence community with knowledge of FISA-authorized programs and activities to submit a covered complaint to the Comptroller General, to the House or Senate intelligence committees, or in accordance with a process under the National Security Act of 1947 with respect to reports made to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. Defines a ""covered complaint"" as a complaint or information concerning FISA-authorized programs and activities that an employee or contractor reasonably believes is evidence of: (1) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or (2) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Subjects an officer or employee of an element of the intelligence community to administrative sanctions, including termination, for taking retaliatory action against an employee or contractor who seeks to disclose, or who discloses, such information.[/INST]

""I'll come out as soon as I finish my manuscript on the Seven Seals."" Oh, OK, David.

That doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a shitload of serious weapons. Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and twisting their impressionable little minds.  This was no MOVE fuck-up. A helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously. There were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming the stuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one, but not three fires. No way.

 Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth, you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with the newsreporting if you care.  Many cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he is lying, change their stories to match his.  And if the Feds also lie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their stories to match the Feds.    Neither sides are interested in the truth.  The Media is more interested, but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves to the ratings and deliberately distort.    For me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  I doubt the Feds did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon.  The real unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon, so I figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus  being persecuted by the authorities, and had followers[/INST]

Claude, I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A( retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by  high sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection).  The  types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells  and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing  process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond  to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't  know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are  capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major  breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin  A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using  vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go  on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on  your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done,  more will need to follow to firm up[/INST]

The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being down after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like Flatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If last night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole championship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is to pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter.

A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital because of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to do a lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite.  I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT lab had been very unpleasant to her.  To begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may have a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put into this big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with annoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV catheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain.  The technician just stopped[/INST]

 (about my reply)   It a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming, Usenet, diplomacy is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through, isn't it?   Kevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little about, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the lines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannot be algorithmic in his book _The emperor's new mind: Concerning computers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose's claim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look, could be just illusions.  We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective, realising that it might not be anything special, but certainly useful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds or not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave  just like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a ""total synthesis of C. elegans"" from the elements. Would such a worm[/INST]

Kent Sandvik and Jon Livesey made essentially the same response, so this time Kent's article gets the reply:   This begs the question of whether it ever ""started""-- perhaps because accuracy was always an intention.   It makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away (reporters, if you will).  As I said earlier, the ""telephone"" metaphor is innately bad, because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the aims of writing these sorts of texts.

 Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer?  I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist.  A bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given intravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein.   After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high  concentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.  As far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the IV line.  What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if[/INST]

 The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere.  Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his ""last"" stand is because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial government is months away from a provincial election...it is the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price... and it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with the players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing.  Pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.  He can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his price if Edmonton doesn't.  Edmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and surrendered supremacy to Calgary, and over the next few years Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks. It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team too...because Northlands wants to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing.  However, in this case, about the long-term financial viability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically  right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right[/INST]

I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view.  I don't like to see stickwork, but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move (I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm  talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the  player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of  position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with helpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who I have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)[/INST]

  Assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss, congestion or popping in the ears, you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a bulb syringe, but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or may even make things worse.  (My wife would disagree, she does it successfully every six months or so.)  In any case DO NOT ATTEMPT ANYTHING WITH Q-TIPS!!!

  Umm, weren't you the one objecting to someone who is a ""licensed physician"" being called a quack?  Or is it just that being a licensed physician is a good defense against charges of quackery when the physician agrees with your system of beliefs?   Actually, I almost never use the term quack.  When I discuss ""systemic yeast syndrome"", however, I always point out that mainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis (and I agree with that characterization).   Really?  I bet virtually everyone reading these posts understands what Steve Dyer, Gordon Banks, and I am implying when we have talked about systemic yeast syndrome as a quack diagnosis.  Would you prefer the word ""charlatan""?  (I don't happen to think that all quacks are charlatans since I suspect that some believe in the ""diseases"" they are diagnosing.)   Why?  Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out in SCI.med that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the  existence of systemic yeast syndrome?[/INST]

I like the Clark-WIlliams-Bonds order. Pitchers can only walk Clark with 2 outs (unlike last year).  Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming in the on-deck circle.  Since Matt has a terrible batting eye, this helps the Giants a lot.  When Bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by Thompson, Manwaring, or Clayton.  If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't want him to run because a ""caught stealing"" could take you out of a big inning.  Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).  The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the  bases infront of Bonds... and I think that's a problem the  Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot.[/INST]

TITLE I--COMMERCIAL PRIVACY Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights Act of 2015 Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to initiate a rulemaking to require covered entities that collect or use information about individuals to carry out security measures to protect personally identifiable information, unique identifier information, and other information that may be used to identify a specific individual. Defines ""covered entity"" as a person (a person, partnership, or corporation over which the FTC has authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, a common carrier subject to the Communications Act of 1934, or a nonprofit organization) who collects, uses, transfers, or stores such information concerning more than 5,000 individuals during any consecutive 12-month period. Directs the FTC to require covered entities to: (1) notify individuals of their practices regarding the collection, use, transfer, and storage of such information; (2) provide timely notice before implementing a material change in such practices; (3) offer individuals a mechanism to provide opt-in consent for any unauthorized use of such information or a third party's use for behavioral advertising or marketing; and (4) provide access to, and methods to correct, stored information. Permits covered entities to execute contracts with service providers to collect, use, and store information on behalf of the covered entity. Restricts covered entities to the collection of only as much information relating to an individual as reasonably necessary to: (1) process or enforce a transaction or deliver a requested service, including inventory management, financial reporting and accounting, planning, product or service improvement, forecasting, and customer support; (2) prevent or detect fraud or provide for a secure environment; (3) investigate a possible crime or comply with a law; (4) market or advertise to such individual if the information used for such marketing or advertising was collected directly by the covered entity; and (5) conduct internal operations and customer research, including the collection of information about Internet website visits and click-through rates to improve website navigation and the customer's experience. Limits the duration of time that a covered entity is authorized to retain such information to only the period necessary to provide the transaction, deliver the service, or comply with a law. Restricts the use of retained information to the purpose for which it was collected or a reasonably related purpose. Directs covered entities that contract to transfer information to third parties to prohibit such third parties from combining transferred information that is not personally identifiable with other information in order to identify the individual without the individual's opt-in consent. Requires covered entities to attempt to establish procedures to ensure the accuracy of personally identifiable information that could be used to deny consumers benefits or cause significant harm. Sets forth the circumstances under which a covered entity may be required to provide notice of a breach of security to: (1) U.S. citizens or residents whose personally identifiable information is reasonably believed to have been acquired or accessed, (2) the FTC, (3) third parties, (4) service providers, and (5) credit reporting agencies. Exempts a covered entity from certain notice requirements if: the covered entity, following a breach of security, concludes that there is no reasonable risk of identity theft, fraud, or other unlawful conduct; or the covered entity participates in a security program that blocks the use of the personally identifiable information to initiate an unauthorized financial transaction before it is charged to the account of the individual and that notifies affected individuals after a security breach that resulted in attempted fraud or an attempted unauthorized transaction. Requires a covered entity to notify a federal government entity designated by the Department of Homeland Security if a breach of security involves: (1) the personally identifiable information of more than 10,000 individuals, (2) a database containing the personally identifiable information of more than 1 million individuals, (3) federal government databases, or (4) the personally identifiable information of federal employees or contractors involved in national security or law enforcement. Directs the designated entity to provide each notice it receives to: the U.S. Secret Service; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the FTC; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, if mail fraud is involved; attorneys general of affected states; and appropriate federal agencies for law enforcement, national security, or data security purposes. Sets forth enforcement provisions for the FTC, the Department of Justice, and states. Establishes civil penalties for state actions against covered entities that recklessly or repeatedly violate specified requirements. Prohibits this title from being construed to provide a private right of action. Directs the FTC to initiate a rulemaking to establish requirements for a nongovernmental organization to administer safe harbor programs under which participants are exempted from certain requirements of this title if they implement particular mechanisms that protect against unauthorized information uses and provide consumers a means of opting out of the transfer of specified information to third parties. TITLE II--ONLINE PRIVACY OF CHILDREN Do Not Track Kids Act of 2015 Amends the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to apply the prohibitions against collecting personal information from children to online applications and mobile applications directed to children. Establishes additional privacy protections against the collection of personal or geolocation information from children and minors. Revises the definition of: ""operator"" to include online and mobile applications (currently, only Internet websites and online services) and to make such definition apply specifically to operators and providers of such websites, services, or applications who, for commercial purposes, in interstate or foreign commerce, collect or maintain personal information from or about their users, allow another person to collect such personal information, or allow users of such websites, services, or applications to publicly disclose personal information; and ""disclosure"" to mean the release of personal information (currently, the release of personal information collected from a child in identifiable form). Requires verifiable parental consent, under specified circumstances, for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information of a child, including certain online contact information collected in response to a specific request from a child when such information is used to contact a different child. Prohibits, without verifiable parental consent in the case of a child or without consent of the minor in the case of a minor, an operator of a website, online service, online application, or mobile application directed to children or minors, or an operator having actual knowledge that personal information being collected is from children or minors, from: (1) using, disclosing to third parties, or compiling personal information collected from children or minors for targeted marketing purposes; and (2) collecting geolocation information in a manner that violates the regulations prescribed under this title. Defines a ""minor"" as an individual over the age of 12 and under the age of 16. Prohibits an operator from discontinuing service provided to a child or minor on the basis of a refusal, by the child's parent or the minor, to permit the further use or maintenance in retrievable form, or future collection, of certain personal or geolocation information from such individuals, to the extent that the operator is capable of providing such service without such information. Requires an operator of a website, online service, online application, or mobile application directed to children or minors to treat all users as children or minors for purposes of this title, except as permitted by regulation. Prohibits an operator of a website, online service, or such applications directed to minors from collecting personal information from minors unless such operator has adopted, and complies with, a Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Teens that is consistent with the Fair Information Practices Principles established by this title. Requires the FTC to promulgate regulations that require operators to implement mechanisms that permit a user to erase content submitted by such user that is publicly available through such websites, services, or applications and that contains or displays personal information of children or minors. Sets forth enforcement provisions for the FTC, other federal agencies, and states.[/INST]

   Why shouldn't I mind? It sounds as if you are proceeding with just the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of. I always preceeded my statements with ""it is my understanding that..."" Now, I have made my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and  with Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility. After hearing your seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim regarding himself, I have withdrawn that portion of my statement regarding that claim. However, I have received _no_ such response regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams. There is nothing obfuscationist about my claims, which are always made clearly.   I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and  other such opaque ""concepts"" often used by people to camoflage the  baselessness of their positions, particularly in matters of theology.

Graduation Promise Act of 2009 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to states and, through them, subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for differentiated high school improvement systems targeting support to schools with low student achievement and graduation rates after such schools fail for two consecutive years to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) pursuant to state academic performance standards. Allots grant funds to states pursuant to a formula that favors states with low graduation rates and a high percentage of students attending low-income LEAs. Requires state grantees to establish comprehensive school performance indicators and minimum annual improvement benchmarks for use, in addition to current AYP measures, in analyzing school performance and determining the improvement category into which a school is placed. Directs LEA subgrantees to: (1) categorize each of their schools that fail to make AYP for two consecutive years as needing targeted intervention, whole school reforms, or replacement; (2) convene a local school improvement team for each of such schools that will use performance indicators, AYP measures, and other relevant data to conduct a school needs assessment and develop a multiyear school improvement plan tailored to the school's need categorization; and (3) support the successful implementation of such plans and district-wide high school improvement strategies. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to LEAs, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education to develop and implement, or replicate, effective secondary school models for struggling students and dropouts.[/INST]

 [ ... my stuff deleted ... ]   Bill, you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its sole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesn't.  This board is used to discuss atheism as a philosophy, to share posters' experiences regarding atheism, to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole, to share resources relating to atheism, and even to socialize with others with similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who come here to preach, it is also used to argue the case for atheism.     If you want to accuse people of lying, please do so directly.  The phrase ""deliberately mistaken"" is rather oxymoronic.     The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are Christianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers into good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been accomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American Friends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread For The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring to mind.  (Can someone with more[/INST]

ESPN is pathetic, I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage and I agree with all of you.  Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up over nothing.  We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck.  I mean have you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey? It sucks, I mean really sucks!!!  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the ass.  I was really pissed of about last night, coverage.  I go to school in Ohio I *know* the Indians suck, so why show them?  If I were Bill Clement I would shoot myself.  Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going to happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring Devils game.  Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly belive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract      [/INST]

 Your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine (thanks, Uncle Sam!).  I've been wearing Miracle Ear canal aids for about 5 months now and I find them to be acceptable.  They are molded to the shape of your ear canal, and tuned to  your hearing curve.  They are comfortable to wear and almost invisible, if you're worried about that (although if you're currently wearing behind the ear models, that's not an issue).  The cost:  I paid $1200 each for mine, through the Miracle Ear counter at Sears.

Tim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average stats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive performances, compared to league average.  I've combined those with my position-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total run values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the MVP award.  Major caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if San Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are position-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don't know what to do about catchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions  of Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.    Having said that, there are still some surprises.  Let's look National League first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.

 Absolutely not true. Without religion - either an established one or one you invent for yourself - the theist and atheist are equally (not) interested in God, because without religious revelation there is _no_ information about God available. Strip away the dogma and the theists/atheists are no different, simply holding a different opinion on a matter of little practical importance.   Sorry, but that doesn't help.

  Sorry, I still don't buy it.  You're certainly right that the runner is not out merely for running out of the baseline: he must interfere with the play.  But the argument here is over what constitutes interference. You certainly cannot infer from what you've quoted that the batter-runner must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference: you haven't posted a definition of interference at all.  IMO this calls for one of the ""approved ruling[s]"" that go in small print in the rulebook.  Something like:  APPROVED RULING: If in the judgement of the umpire the runner, by running to the left of the allowed path, caused the fielder to make a bad throw, blocks the vision of the fielder receiving the throw, or otherwise impedes the defensive team's making a play on him, the batter-runner shall be judeged guilty of interference.  or  APPROVED RULING: The runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball.  -- In the absence of such an approved ruling I claim that this is a poor rules trivia question--since it[/INST]

acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu (Turin Turambar, ME Department of Utter Misery) said re. Dan Schaertel's article [if I followed the quoting right]:     I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take the appellation `Rabbi' seriously then Jesus had a full grasp of contemporary `scripture'  Mat21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures...  Mat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing Mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.  Following from this, he would have been in a wonderful position to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:  Mat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, Mat26:54 that thus it must be?  Mat26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the Mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples Mat26:56 forsook him, and fled.  If the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not been accessible then it probably would be a different matter.[/INST]

   What the hell are U talking about? ESPN showed Pens/Devils game as advertised.   BUt the morons at ESPN should know that Pens will kick Devils ass and the   game will be boring. I'd rather see Boston/Buffalo game which seems to be   an exciting series since noone had expected Buffalo to get past the first   round.     Well let's hope they change their mind on THU's game and show some other   game. The Pens series is really getting boring. I want to see some    exciting game no matter who wins. If NHL wants a major network contract   then they better put some brains in ESPN people.      [/INST]

 *sigh*  It is standard procedure to suspend law enforcement officers, or re-assign them to administrative (non enforcement) duties, while an investigation into possible misconduct is going on. The Administration has given no indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. And given that the president, attorney general and governor were all involved in the decisions that led to the Waco Massacre, they should also suspend all activities regarding law enforcement. Given their positions, that equates to an enforced vacation.  [/INST]

 I don't think there is a general distinction.  Rather, there are two classes of chronic hepatitis: chronic active hepatitis and chronic persistent hepatitis.  I can't think of any other disease where the term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.  Much as these two terms ""chronic active"" and ""chronic persistent"" sound fuzzy, the actual distinction between the two conditions is often fairly fuzzy as well.[/INST]

: The willingness of true believers : to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is : well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.  It does say something about the depth of their belief.  Religion has both deluded believers and con men.  The difference is often how far they will follow their beliefs.  I have no first hand, or even second hand, knowledge of how the  original apostles died.  If they began a myth in hopes of exploiting it for profit, and followed that myth to the death, that would be inconsistent.  Real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would  lead to discomfort, pain and death.[/INST]

Being a NORMAL user of Ny-Quil :), I checked the 'ingredients' and have a very hard time believing it.  They are:  250 g acetaminophen 30 mg Pseudoephedrine HCl 10 mg Dextromethorphan HBr 6.25 mg Doxylamine Succinate  (per softgel)  Can someone settle our bet (a package of Ny-Quil of course :) -- what  effect would 20-30 of these babies have?  *-Nathan-*  -- [/INST]

 : Bowman is the genius...Johnson isn't.  Bowman is a great coach...Johnson, : a very good one.  However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and : Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and : delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is : a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.    IMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at  this time. Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his  group of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in  Pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one.  (Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the  change.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this  year, a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the  other hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players  to new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both  of which came at exactly the right time.

 Sorry, Fred, but for the purposes under discussion here, I must disagree.  Your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue against communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires, since those did not represent *true* communism.  In judging the practical consequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today, it is precisely the Khomeini's of the world, the Rushdie-fatwa supporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the world Muslim community to those extremists, that we must look to.  Perhaps unfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned with whether Islam is the right religion for them, or whether the Qur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but how Islam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be like if Islam gains in influence.  When I consider such possibilities, it is with not inconsiderable fear.[/INST]

  Ah, but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and a sense of urgency because of the game clock (not all the time, but it happens when there's less than 5 minutes to go quite often).  This sense creates drama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's attention.  In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about (here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time?  And they're just playing a sophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/ touch-self-in-interesting-locations.  There's a lot of ""dead time"" with the players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher who then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans will appreciate that one).  To the non baseball junkie this is boring. At any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid fan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on T.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.

 Hmm... all reports from Texas authorities indicate that none of the children which the group released showed any signs of child abuse.. given that the same results were found the last time the group was investigated for such allegations, I can pretty much state that I strongly suspect the government of disinformation /deception on this issue.  And about stockpiling weapons/food, many recognized religous groups practice maintaining a one years supply of food, and some even maintain a supply of weapons and ammunition, why are those two facts grounds  for an armed assault?

The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start violence.   When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back.

 This whole thread is rediculous.  Who cares if they had a stove going or not.  Does it matter if they had a stove burning, or lanterns burning, or candles burning, or someone smoking, etc, etc, etc.  The premise is that the FBI was filling the house with napalm so that it would catch fire.  This is crazy.  FBI was NOT PUMPING NAPALM into the Davidians home.  You will have to have pretty damn strong evidence to convince me of that.  I can believe mass suicide/murder by Koresh.

  I don't think I've changed my stance at all.  My original stance was that a painless execution was not a cruel one.  I didn't say what would be considered cruel, only that a painless death wasn't.  Now, cruelty must involve some sort of suffering, I believe.  I don't think someone that gets shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much.  Even a hanging probably produces one sharp instance of pain, but it's over so quickly...   Pardon?   No.  Well, again I stated that a painless death isn't cruel, but I don't think I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  I think that some are cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.   Anything more than an instant, I guess.  Any death by suffocation asphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the gas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  I'd say that any pain that lasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may be an arbitrary cutoff, I suppose).[/INST]

No Subsidies Without Verification Act of 2015 This bill disallows the health plan premium assistance tax credit or cost-sharing reduction under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act before an individual's eligibility and the accurate amount of the credit or reduction is verified. Verification requires a review of the information provided by an applicant and resolution of any inconsistency between the information and the records of the Departments of the Treasury or Homeland Security or the Social Security Administration. Individuals are exempt from the penalty for not maintaining minimum essential coverage for any month for which a premium tax credit is being claimed and that begins before verification is completed. The premium tax credit and reduced cost-sharing are suspended for an individual for whom a subsidy was allowed before enactment of this Act until the individual's eligibility is verified. A special enrollment period is provided for an individual who terminated enrollment in a qualified plan during the period of suspension.[/INST]

Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's hard to digest anyway.   For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal ""last"" longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How tight are your clothes.

This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots.  1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used      to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is      misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.     Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug     therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute      it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this     distinction becomes important.  2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible   diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something  people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or  unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.    One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual  can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they  are an unending source of anxiety. [/INST]

 Well, as I remember Jacoby's ""Mythmaker"" talks about this to cite one source -- but I'm not sure if all Christians have read this book. In addition my social experiences is from being raised and educated as a Lutheran, having a lot of Christian friends, and I even have played in two Christian rock bands!  So, over to you, do you have any counter claims, sources et  rest that shows that Christianity does not have the concept of a social promise that is independent on the social status?

CNN just reported the ATF and the FBI have begun killing everyone in the United States. A press release stated this action was required because bugs had revealed that many people were doing something illegal in their homes, and statistical data indicated that those who weren't might someday do something illegal. An ATF spokesperson, just before he shot himself, stated that ""this would clean up things once and for all"".  If the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the FBI has indicated they will ""burn them, just like we did those kooks in Waco"".  It hasn't been decided how the new proposed ""energy tax"" will enter into this, an IRS representative stated ""We're looking at the tax code to determine if taxes really end at death. With this many dead Americans, we don't want to overlook anything"". An ATF agent ran into the room, and shot her.[/INST]

 I'm a little worried about this pitching thing.  6.08 is scarry even for the first 16 games of the season.  Mesa (sp?) seems to be settling down.  He pitched well against the Red Soxs, but The Rocket matched him.  I got a chance to watch them play against California Wednesday and he pitched well also.  Then the dam broke.  Wickander came in and promptly it was 6-1.  (3 run homer by Snow?).  I heard the guys on ESPN say that 7 of the TRIBE's top 10 prospects are pitchers.

I had stones several years ago, and there's now way I could have made it without heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the hospital. I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would dissolve them. If the stones are passible, the best thing she could do is drink LOTS of water, and hope that they pass, but every time they move a little, the pain will be excrutiating. I was told by my doctor at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (Yes, by a male doctor, so I'm sure some of you women will disagree).

 Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon, I think that the best clinical  trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal  candida blooms L.

marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu (Kevin Marshall) <1r2eba$hsq@csugrad.cs.vt.edu>  Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on faith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  That is what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, or belief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational) justification.  For example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't know why they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.  Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based on new information, or increased mental faculty.  Faith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that makes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather than a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion, because there is no faith nor dogma.  Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher is not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.  A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.

Just a side note, squid/octopi made their way to the ice in Buffalo. I still don't understand why Buffalo, but maybe it's lucky.  :-)  btw, they shovel them up from the ice here, using the shovel used to scoop up the snow the zamboni leaves as it leaves the ice.  Although Blue did give some technical directions on its removal, motioning with his stick.     [/INST]

 I've seen children do this and wondered about something.  If the mucus in one's nose collects (filters) particles going into the airway, if a child then picks and ingests this material, might it have a vaccinatory effect, since if the body ingests airborne diseases or other 'stuff' on the mucus, the body might generate antibodies for this small ""invasion""?  Maybe this is why some children don't get sick very often? :-)                          - tom[/INST]

(Susan Clark) asks:  I am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game, but Tod Hartje, who played for Harvard in college and then went on to play in the AHL (initially for Moncton and currently for Providence-- thanks to Daryl  Turner for the update!) appeared on David Letterman's show about two years ago now.  Tod has the distinction of being the first American born player to go  and play in the former Soviet Union. This was arranged by Jets GM Mike  Smith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those  European players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL.  Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years. He wrote a book on his experiences called ""Behind the Red Line"" (check it out!) and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them.  -- Mike [/INST]

Moving to Work Reform Act of 2015 This bill prohibits the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from entering into or extending any Moving to Work agreement for any public housing agency (PHA) for participation in the Moving to Work Demonstration Program, unless the agreement is subject to specified terms and conditions set forth by this Act for its entire duration. (Under the Moving to Work Demonstration Program up to 30 selected PHAs, including Indian housing authorities, may administer the public or Indian housing program and the Section 8 housing assistance payments program in ways designed to reduce costs and achieve greater cost-effectiveness in federal expenditures, provide incentives for heads of households to become economically self-sufficient, and increase housing choices for lower-income families.) Under such an agreement a PHA: may not establish any new rent policy that raises rent burdens for a significant portion of participating families, or causes specified other results, unless certain conditions are met; may use funds appropriated for renewal of tenant-based rental assistance only for payments assisting eligible families with housing costs; shall receive funding for renewal of tenant-based rental assistance under the same formula applied to nonparticipating PHAs; must provide ongoing housing assistance to substantially the same number of eligible low-income families as it could assist ordinarily but with average cost burdens no higher than those of families assisted under Sections 8 (low-income housing assistance) and 9 (Public Housing Capital and Operating Funds) of the United States Housing Act of 1937; and develop and implement a plan to expand families' access to neighborhoods with low crime, high-performing schools, or other indicators of high opportunity, if a disproportionately low share of PHA-assisted families lives in such neighborhoods. HUD may not waive specified housing-related requirements. HUD must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Demonstration Program to: analyze the risks and potential benefits of expanding it to additional agencies; and identify reforms, and selection criteria in case the Demonstration Program is expanded, that would improve its effectiveness in testing innovative policies while minimizing adverse effects on low-income families and ensuring efficient use of federal funds to meet the most pressing housing needs.[/INST]

Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!  The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T.  I can't stand it!  Aside from frustrated ravings, I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good  on most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense.  Boston players can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net except for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he's also getting plenty of help. Boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the  series score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the  game.  As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period 2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single game (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite bleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that, they have an excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres[/INST]

Here is something crossposted from the AHL mailing list:     In a discussion between me and Chris Lerch, the subject of Springfield's  1st round upset of the Providence Bruins came up. Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL  hierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians. He noted that the offices for the league are in Spring. and many ex-Indians are working for the AHL. Furthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup  finals between Roch and Spring, that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office and that:  ""...there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and staff attending all games with the Springfield brass, including sitting in their box for the game in Springfield and, according to the Rochester media, openly cheering for Springfield.""  Certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true. I don't know if this is anything more than whining on the part of the Amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the Wings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises questions about President Jack Butterfield's leadership.

(and howe, for the minor league handbook)"".  and i am not sure how the 1993 bill james player ratings book qualifies as a ""book with statistics"", while the elias analyst is a ""statistics book"". the analyst contains more stats, sure, but it also contains more dialogue.  finally, the point was not about the word ""statistics"".  it was about ""money-grubbing"".  i don't see how anyone who has looked at the bill james player ratings book cannot consider him money-grubbing.[/INST]

American Jobs Matter Act of 2015 Requires an executive agency to include the effects on employment within the United States (a jobs impact statement) in the evaluation factors that must be considered in each solicitation for competitive proposals for contracts in excess of $1 million for the procurement of: (1) manufactured goods, (2) goods or services listed in a required report of industrial base capabilities, or (3) any item procured as part of a major defense acquisition program. Allows an offeror's jobs impact statement to include a guarantee that jobs created or retained in the United States will not be moved outside the United States after award of the contract unless doing so is required to provide the goods or services stipulated in the contract or is in the best interest of the federal government. Requires each agency to: (1) assess, annually, the accuracy of such a statement submitted by an offeror awarded a contract; and (2) track the number of jobs created or retained during the performance of such contract. Allows the agency, if the number of jobs created or retained falls short of agency estimates, to consider this as a factor that affects a contractor's past performance in the award of future contracts. Requires: (1) the Secretary of Defense to report annually on the frequency of use within the Department of Defense of jobs impact statements in the evaluation of competitive proposals, and (2) revision of the Department of Defense Supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement this Act.[/INST]

I'm not sure were this thread has been before i popped in, but I've never thought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or competence.

LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE), for proposals that must also obtain authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the United States Maritime Administration to site, construct, expand, or operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities, to issue a decision on an application for authorization to export natural gas within 45 days after the later of: (1) the conclusion of the review to site, construct, expand, or operate the LNG facilities required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA); or (2) the date of enactment of this Act. Deems a NEPA review to be concluded when the lead agency: (1) publishes an Environmental Impact Statement if the project requires one; (2) publishes a Finding of No Significant Impact if the project needs an Environmental Assessment; or (3) determines that an application is eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant to NEPA regulations. (A ""categorical exclusion"" under NEPA is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementing environmental regulations and for which, therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is required.) Confers upon either the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or the circuit in which the export facility will be located original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the review of: (1) a DOE order regarding the application; or (2) DOE failure to issue a final decision on the application. Requires the Court, if it finds in a civil action that DOE has failed to issue a final decision on an application, to order DOE to issue a decision within 30 days. Requires the Court to set any civil action brought under this Act on the docket, for expedited consideration, as soon as practical after the filing date of the initial pleading. Amends the Natural Gas Act to direct the Secretary, in the case of any LNG export authorization, to require the applicant to report to DOE, according to specified timelines, the names of the one or more countries of destination to which the exported LNG is delivered.[/INST]

A ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 BMG)  2.   A ban on ""sniper rifles""  3. A ban on ""stockpiling"" guns and ammunition.   BTW: Shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman I have seen on      the news. I wonder how he finds the floor in the morning. ------- MICHAEL F.

Life Sciences Jobs and Investment Act of 2011 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) an increased research tax credit for qualified initial life sciences research expenses; and (2) certain corporations a tax deduction for dividends received which are reinvested solely in the United States to hire scientists and researchers engaged in life science research, fund life science research at research consortia, eligible small businesses, universities, and federal laboratories, or build or lease new facilities to be used primarily for qualified life sciences research. Terminates such tax incentives after 2016. Defines ""qualified initial life sciences research expenses"" as amounts, up to $150 million, attributable to the study of biology, biochemistry, biophysics, bioengineering, microbiology, genetics, or physiology, but excluding sociology or psychology. Directs the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to take necessary steps to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this Act and to report to Congress on the status of such compliance and related enforcement.[/INST]

   That is the standard advice in dermatology texts. The soak part greatly increases the inconvenience.  Don't bother unless it doesn't work otherwise.   Exactly, but it adds to the ""ritual"" aspect, which is important for us suggestible patients.  (Posters, don't bother to repeat the  rationale for the soak.)   Greasy no matter what. Vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is  famous for that.  One text states that the more greasy a dry-skin cream is, the more effective.     Try USP lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  USP lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (don't buy the more expensive perfumed lanolin mixture).  As I've commented before, petrolatum is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in biological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close, even on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there for months or more, and have associations with cancer.  Don't panic, but also don't believe it's God's gift to the human skin. [/INST]

 [Some discussion about whether Elias is money grubbing deleted]      Some thoughts and facts,  1.)  Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.  However he has almost nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name. (The handbook, but not the scoreboard).  To the best of my knowledge, the only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section of the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.  2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James' early stuff was hampered by the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price. Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  You can call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Having attempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they[/INST]

  Well, yes.  This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories.  There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is obscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to copy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same ""errors"".  This would appear to tell us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we don't know what they did before that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the point at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (and in some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for the most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.  You're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Some people like to use the game of ""telephone"" as a metaphor for the transmission of the texts.  This clearly wrong.  The texts are transmitted accurately.[/INST]

 You started it...   You most certainly did!   Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel.  Yet you would pinch-hit Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and Sabo will be a choke hitter.  Right?  I'd call that ""predicting the future"".   Right.  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits, even matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some advantage if used properly.  EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance.  And in this case, everything else pointed to Sabo.   That comes down to the same thing.  When Perez left Sabo in, he was predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel.  By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite.   Well, yes.  You are aware of its existance.

African Elephant Conservation and Legal Ivory Possession Act of 2015 This bill reauthorizes the African Elephant Conservation Act (AECA) through FY2020. Ivory may be imported or exported under the AECA and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) if: (1) the raw ivory or worked ivory is solely for a museum; (2) it was lawfully importable into the United States on February 24, 2014, regardless of when it was acquired; or (3) the worked ivory was previously lawfully possessed in the United States. The Department of the Interior may station one U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement officer in the primary U.S. diplomatic or consular post in each African country that has significant population of African elephants to assist local wildlife rangers in protecting the elephants and facilitating the apprehension of individuals who illegally kill them or assist in killing them. Interior must certify a finding that a county is a significant transit or destination point for illegal ivory trade and report the certification to the President for the purposes of the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967. The Pelly Amendment authorizes the President to embargo wildlife products when the Interior certifies that a country is engaging in trade or certain actions that diminishes the effectiveness of an international agreement for the conservation of endangered or threatened species. This bill authorizes under the AECA and ESA: (1) the possession, sale, delivery, receipt, shipment, or transportation of African elephant ivory that has been lawfully imported or crafted in the United States, and (2) the importation of a sport-hunted African elephant trophy if the country in which the elephant was taken had elephants that are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) at the time the trophy was taken.[/INST]

 IMHO this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all  of baseball.  My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot  pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least  appear in the on-deck circle.  Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot  excede three runs.  I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in  determining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the  ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in  the next half inning and earn the win.  Has this pitcher earned a win, no  way.  I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his  teammates rally to tie the score.  Assume he came in to start the fourth  and left after the eighth.  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in  the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win.  The  third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no ""stat"" [/INST]

 Two notes of interest from Texas:  The Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering judgements that are contrary to the police view.  He presented evidence a few years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had his hands in the air.  This does not bode well for the boys in black.  The Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for the ATF.  I have heard them referred to as ""those fucking cowboys"".  The DPS was totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as ""traffic cops"".  ATF now has two strikes against them.  Finally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATF agents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the flashed ""an automatic weapon"" at a cop.  Lots of pissed of cops.  And you wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the ATF.[/INST]

Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act - (Sec. 2) Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize states to adopt and implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. Requires each state governor to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) within six months about whether such state will implement such a program. Requires states that decide to implement such a program to: (1) submit to the Administrator within 36 months a certification that such program meets the specifications of this Act; and (2) maintain either an approved municipal solid waste program for the control of hazardous disposal or an authorized state hazardous waste program. Establishes minimum requirements for coal combustion residuals permit programs. Requires: (1) the revised criteria established by this Act to apply to such programs; (2) landfills, surface impoundments, or other land-based units that may receive coal combustion residuals (structures) to be designed, constructed, and maintained to provide for containment of the maximum volumes of coal combustion residuals appropriate for the structure; (3) such programs to apply such revised criteria to surface impoundments; and (4) new structures that first receive coal combustion residuals after this Act's enactment to be constructed with a base located a minimum of two feet above the upper limit of the natural water table. Authorizes: (1) state agency heads to require action to correct structural integrity deficiencies according to a schedule for structures that are classified as posing a high hazard potential pursuant to the guidelines published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) entitled ""Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety: Hazard Potential Classification System for Dams""; (2) state agency heads to require that such a structure close if such deficiency is not corrected according to such schedule; (3) states to inspect structures and implement and enforce such permit program; and (4) states to address wind dispersal of dust from coal combustion residuals by requiring dust control measures. Sets forth revised criteria for such programs with respect to: (1) design, groundwater monitoring, corrective action, and closure and post-closure for structures; (2) location restrictions for new structures in floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, and unstable areas; (3) criteria for air quality, financial assurance, surface water, and record keeping; (4) criteria for run-on and run-off control systems for landfills and other land-based units, other than surface impoundments that receive coal combustion residuals; and (5) run-off control systems for surface impoundments. Authorizes states to determine that such criteria is not needed for the management of their coal combustion residuals permit program. Authorizes the Administrator to treat such state determination as a deficiency if it does not accurately reflect the needs for the management of coal combustion residuals in the state. Requires the Administrator to provide a state with notice of, and an opportunity to remedy, deficiencies. Requires the Administrator to implement such a program for a state only if: (1) the governor of such state notifies the Administrator that such state will not implement a program, (2) the state is notified of, but fails to remedy, program deficiencies, or (3) the state notifies the Administrator that it will no longer implement such a program. Sets forth provisions concerning resumption of implementation by states. Requires the time period and method for a structure's closure to be set forth in a schedule in a closure plan that takes into account the site-specific characteristics of such structure. Directs the closure plan for a surface impoundment to require the removal of liquid and the stabilization of remaining waste as necessary to support the final cover. Prohibits the Administrator from applying such programs to the utilization, placement, and storage of coal combustion residuals at surface mining and reclamation operations. (Sec. 3) Prohibits this Act from being construed to alter the EPA's regulatory determination, entitled ""Notice of Regulatory Determination on Wastes from the Combustion of Fossil Fuels,"" that the fossil fuel combustion wastes addressed in that determination do not warrant regulation under such Act.[/INST]

 And you'd be wrong about that too.  Note that Texas isn't unique in this ""more with-gun deaths than with-car deaths"", but some of the other states where it happens have extremely strict gun laws.  Oops - so much for the ""meaning"".  It isn't clear that the comparision means anything anyway as car accidents are unintentional while gun deaths aren't, but if we're going to make it, let's at least be honest.   Give it up for what?  Gun control doesn't have any benefits, so it fails by this standard.   Note that insurance gives me something in return - gun control doesn't.   That's half the question - the rest is ""and what do you get for your sacrifice"".  If the answer to the second question is ""nothing"", as it is for gun control, then we don't have to ask the first question because getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified.  -andy[/INST]

Trade Enforcement Improvement Act of 2015 This bill amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to direct the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to consider expanded factors when determining whether imports of merchandise receiving a countervailable subsidy from an exporting country substantially weaken the remedial effect of any countervailing duty order. These factors shall include: an increase in the U.S. market share of those imports after the filing by domestic manufacturers or unions of a petition for remedies, an increase in underselling of the domestic like product by the frequency or magnitude of such imports after the filing of the petition, and a weakening of the industry of the domestic like product after the petition filing. The ITC shall consider the same expanded factors when determining whether imports of merchandise at less than fair value substantially weaken the remedial effect of any antidumping duty order. The ITC may determine that a U.S. industry is threatened with material injury if imminent future imports of subject merchandise will likely render the industry's performance materially worse than it would otherwise have been. The Department of Homeland Security may publish semiannually in the Federal Register a list of any producer, manufacturer, supplier, seller, exporter, or other person located outside the U.S. customs territory to which the ITC has issued a penalty claim for customs violations involving fraud. These violations include any practices aiding or abetting the transshipment, through a country not the country of origin, of textile, apparel, or any goods subject to antidumping or countervailing duty orders, in a manner concealing their true origin or permitting evasion of import quotas or duties. The President may publish an annual list of countries: in which illegal activities have occurred involving transshipped goods or activities designed to evade U.S. quotas or duties; and whose governments fail to demonstrate a good faith effort to cooperate with U.S. authorities in halting such activities.[/INST]

  Well, as a hockey fan, I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say, ""Hey,  let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!"" -- that's fine. It's entirely another to say, ""Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town and move it!""   Of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but from what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000 level that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets thing as an excuse.   I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and the fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the parking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey, USA. How the NHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond  me. I only hope[/INST]

  I definitely do.  That's why I don't like going to see games played on artificial turf :-)   Well, your idea of ""interesting"" differs from mine.  I think batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.  One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its open-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to go on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed, and some games are slow and lazy.  That's fine by me.  Those folks who want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can[/INST]

 As a matter of fact, I just saw a dermatologist the other day, and while I  was there, I asked him about dry skin. I'd been spending a small fortune on various creams, lotions, and other dry skin treatments. He said all I needed was a large jar of vaseline. Soak in a lukewarm tub of water for 10 minutes (ONLY 10 minutes!) then massage in the vaseline, to trap the moisture in. That will help. I haven't tried it yet, but you can bet I will. The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the vaseline properly. If it's not done right, you remain greasy and stick to your clothes. Try it. It's got to be cheaper then spending $30 for 8 oz. of 'natural' lotion.[/INST]

Defending America's Affordable Energy and Jobs Act - Prohibits the President or any federal agency head from promulgating regulations providing for the control of emissions of a greenhouse gas (GHG), enforcing or implementing any law enacted as of the date of enactment of this Act that provides for the control of GHG emissions, taking action relating to or taking into consideration the climate effects of GHG emissions, considering climate effects in implementing or enforcing laws, or conditioning or denying any approval based on climate effects, unless the law, action, or consideration is: (1) determined to be necessary to protect the public health from imminent and substantial harm caused by direct human exposure to the relevant GHG in a concentration that is substantially greater than current and projected future average concentrations of that GHG gas in the global atmosphere; and (2) based solely on effects other than effects relating to atmospheric concentrations of GHG, including climate change. Excepts: (1) regulation of, action with respect to, or consideration of a GHG under the Clean Air Act (CAA) with respect to stratospheric ozone protection other than for the potential or actual effect of the GHG on climate change; or (2) voluntary incentive programs to promote the development or deployment of technologies that reduce GHG emissions. Provides that: (1) the authority of the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to prescribe average fuel economy standards for automobiles does not include any authority with respect to GHGs and is unaffected by this Act; and (2) the requirements set forth in the final rule entitled ""Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards; Final Rule"" remain in effect. Nullifies each other rule promulgated and action taken by the Administrator of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) before the date of enactment of this Act to regulate GHGs for effects relating to atmospheric concentrations of GHGs. Prohibits any law, regulation, or action relating to GHGs from: (1) having any impact on the regulation of stationary sources under CAA; or (2) being considered to be the regulation of pollutants under CAA for any purpose (other than for the regulation of GHG emissions for light-duty motor vehicles from model years 2012 through 2016). Prohibits the Administrator from granting any waiver that allows any state to establish GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and emission standards for motor vehicle engines of model year 2017 or later and invalidates any waiver granted before enactment of this Act. Provides that any provision of a state implementation plan designating GHGs as pollutants that are subject to regulation or otherwise authorizing or requiring limitations on the emission of GHGs under state law is not federally enforceable and is deemed to be stricken from such plan. Prohibits the President or agency heads from examining or making findings or conclusions for purposes of promulgating or issuing policy, guidance, or regulations to address the impacts of GHG emissions on climate change, except as authorized by this Act or another Act of Congress. Prohibits any cause of action from being brought or maintained, or any liability, money damages, or injunctive relief arising from such an action from being imposed, for any contribution of a GHG to climate change or any effect of atmospheric concentrations of a GHG. Prohibits a state from having the authority to: (1) require any entity to procure, hold, or surrender allowances for the emission of GHGs that takes place outside the state; (2) regulate or tax GHG emissions produced outside of the state; or (3) limit the importation of products or electricity into the state based on GHG emissions occurring outside the state.[/INST]

Dear Netters:  Maybe one of you can explain this.  From time to time I experience  a strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) which  can be best described as the feeling of ""losing gravity"", like that one  experiences in a descending elevator.  Needless to say, it is not  enjoyable.  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme  fatigue.  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts  that long, it makes me sweatening.  Initially I called it ""palpitation (spelling?)"" until I later learnt that  the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats.  So, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne person? I always believe I am unique.   Thanks.[/INST]

  I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way it was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the ""yeast connection"".  But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In the meantime, I'd still encourage people who have ""incurable"" chronic sinus problems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with liver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).

Emergency Wildfire and Forest Management Act of 2016 TITLE I--MAJOR DISASTER FOR WILDFIRE ON FEDERAL LAND (Sec. 101) The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to define ""major disaster for wildfire on federal lands"" to mean any wildfire or wildfires that warrant assistance to supplement the efforts and resources of the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture (USDA) on federal lands or on nonfederal lands pursuant to a fire protection agreement or cooperative agreement. (Sec. 102) A process is established for declaration of a major disaster for wildfire on federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Forest Service. Either Interior (for federal land under its jurisdiction) or USDA (for Forest Service land) may request the President to start such a process, and the President in turn may transfer funds to them to conduct wildfire suppression operations on the lands affected. The President shall establish a wildfire suppression operations account for wildfires on federal lands, whose funds shall be transferred to the wildfire suppression subactivity of the Wildland Fire Management Account. If transferred amounts are used to conduct wildfire suppression operations on non-federal land, the appropriate Department shall secure reimbursement for the cost of such operations and transfer the amounts received to the wildfire suppression operations account. The appropriate Department shall report to Congress annually on: the risk-based factors that influenced management decisions regarding wildfire suppression operations of the federal land management agencies under its jurisdiction; a statistically significant sample of large fires; total expenditures for wildfire suppression operations of the federal land management agencies under its jurisdiction, and lessons learned. (Sec. 103) No funds may be transferred to or from the wildfire suppression subactivity of the Wildland Fire Management account or the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund account of the federal land management agencies to or from any other account or subactivity of those agencies that is not used to cover the cost of wildfire suppression operations. TITLE II--EXPEDITED ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND AVAILABILITY OF CATEGORICAL EXCLUSIONS TO EXPEDITE FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES (Sec. 201) This section shall apply whenever the Department concerned, either USDA with respect to National Forest System (NFS) land or Interior with respect to public lands, prepares an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) for a forest management activity that: is developed through a collaborative process; or is covered by a community wildfire protection plan. The primary purpose of which is: the reduction of hazardous fuels, the reduction of fuel connectivity through the installation of fuel and fire breaks, the restoration of forest health and resilience, the protection of a municipal water supply system, or a combination of two or more such purposes. In such an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, the Department concerned shall study, develop, and describe only these two alternatives: the forest management activity proposed, and the alternative of no action. In the case of the alternative of no action, the Department concerned shall evaluate: the effect of no action on forest health, habitat diversity, wildfire potential, insect and disease potential, and other economic and social factors; and the implications of a resulting decline in forest health, loss of habitat diversity, wildfire, or insect or disease infestation on domestic water costs, wildlife habitat loss, and other economic and social factors. (Sec. 202) A categorical exclusion is made available to the Department concerned to propose a forest management activity on NFS land or public land when the activity is developed and implemented through a collaborative process and the primary purpose of the activity is to: address an insect or disease infestation; reduce hazardous fuels; protect a municipal water supply system; maintain, enhance, or modify critical habitat to protect it from catastrophic events; increase water yield; or any combination of such purposes. (A ""categorical exclusion"" is defined under this bill as an exclusion from further analysis and documentation in an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement under the NEPA for a project or activity relating to the management of NFS land or public land.) A forest management activity covered by this categorical exclusion may not contain harvest units exceeding a total of 3,000 acres. A forest management activity covered by this categorical exclusion shall be based upon the best available scientific information and subject to section 206 of this bill (consideration of resource conditions for extraordinary circumstances). (Sec. 203) A categorical exclusion is also made available to the Department concerned to carry out a salvage operation as part of the restoration of NFS land or public land following a catastrophic event. This kind of salvage operation may not contain harvest units exceeding a total of 3,000 acres either, nor may it exceed one-third of the area impacted by the catastrophic event. This kind of salvage operation shall be subject to section 206. (Sec. 204) A categorical exclusion is made available to the Department concerned to carry out a forest management activity on NFS land or public land which is developed and implemented through a collaborative process and when its primary purpose is to modify, improve, enhance, or create early successional forests for wildlife habitat improvement and other purposes, consistent with the applicable forest plan. The Department concerned shall design a forest management activity under this section to meet early successional forest goals so as to maximize production and regeneration of priority species, as identified in the forest plan and consistent with the capability of the activity site. A forest management activity covered by such a categorical exclusion may not contain harvest units exceeding a total of 3,000 acres. A forest management activity covered by this categorical exclusion shall be: based on the best available scientific information, and subject to section 206. (Sec. 205) A categorical exclusion is made available to the Department concerned to carry out specified forest management activities on NFS land or public land which are developed and implemented through a collaborative process and whose primary purpose is to: improve forest health, restore forest health, reduce the risk of wildfire, or achieve state wildlife population goals. A forest management activity covered by this categorical exclusion: may not contain harvest units exceeding a total of 3,000 acres, and shall be based on the best available scientific information. A forest management activity covered by this categorical exclusion shall be subject to section 206. (Sec. 206) The extraordinary circumstances procedures under a specified federal regulation (or a successor regulation) shall apply to a proposal for: a forest management activity that is categorically excluded under this title, or a project that is categorically excluded under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2013. In determining whether extraordinary circumstances preclude a proposal for such an activity or project, the Department concerned shall consider the beneficial effect of the proposed activity or project on sensitive species. The Department concerned shall not determine that extraordinary circumstances preclude such a proposal from being categorically excluded if there is a reasonable beneficial effect or reasonably foreseeable beneficial effect of the proposed activity or project on sensitive species. Uncertainty with respect to the degree of the beneficial effect of a proposed activity or project on sensitive species shall not preclude the use of a categorical exclusion. (Sec. 207) A forest management activity covered by a categorical exclusion granted by this title shall be conducted consistent with the forest plan applicable to the NFS land or public land covered by that activity. (Sec. 208) Forest management activities carried out under this title shall not include the construction of any new permanent roads. The Department concerned may carry out necessary maintenance of, repairs to, or reconstruction of, an existing permanent road for purposes of this title. The Department concerned shall decommission any temporary road constructed under this title within three years of the completion of the project. (Sec. 209) This title does not apply to: a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, any federal land on which the removal of vegetation is prohibited by an Act of Congress, a congressionally designated wilderness study area, or an area in which the activities authorized under this title would be inconsistent with the applicable resource management plan. TITLE III--TRIBAL FORESTRY PARTICIPATION AND PROTECTION (Sec. 301) Interior shall take specified administrative action under the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 within 120 days of receiving a request from an Indian Tribe to enter into an agreement or contract to carry out a project to protect Indian forest land or rangeland (including bordering or adjacent federal land). Interior shall (under current law, may) issue a notice of denial to the Tribe if the request is denied. (Sec. 302) The Department concerned, at the request of an Indian Tribe, may treat federal forest land as Indian forest land for purposes of planning and conducting forest land management activities under the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act if the federal forest land is located within, or mostly within, a geographic area presenting a feature or involving circumstances principally relevant to that Indian tribe. The Department concerned and the Tribe, as part of an agreement to treat federal land as Indian forest land, shall: provide for continued public access (with possible exceptions), continue sharing revenue generated by the federal forest land with state and local governments, comply with applicable prohibitions on the export of unprocessed logs harvested from the federal forest land, recognize all right-of way agreements in effect on federal forest land before tribal forest land management activities commence, and ensure that any commercial timber removed from the federal forest land is sold on a competitive bid basis. (Sec. 303) Interior and USDA may carry out demonstration projects under which federally recognized Indian tribes or tribal organizations may contract to perform administrative, management, and other functions of programs of the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 through contracts entered into under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES (Sec. 402) The State-Supported Forest Management Fund is established in the Treasury to cover costs to plan, carry out, and monitor a forest management activity on NFS land or public land that is developed through a collaborative process, proposed by a resource advisory committee, or covered by a community wildfire protection plan. The Fund shall consist of such amounts as may be: (1) contributed by an eligible entity for deposit into the Fund, (2) appropriated to the Fund, or (3) generated by forest management activities carried out using amounts in the Fund. An ""eligible entity"" is: a state or political subdivision containing NFS land or public land, a publicly chartered utility serving at least one state or its political subdivision, a rural electric company, and any other entity appropriate for participation in the Fund. In making a contribution, an eligible entity may: specify the NFS land or public land for which the contribution may be expended; and limit the types of forest management activities for which the contribution may be expended. The Knutson-Vandenberg Act shall apply to any forest management activity carried out using amounts from the Fund. The Fund shall terminate on September 30, 2018. (Sec. 403) Courts reviewing an agency action shall balance short- and long-term impacts of forest management activities in considering injunctive relief. (Sec. 404) USDA shall establish a competitive grant program to provide financial and technical assistance to: encourage active forest management on cross-boundary priority forest landscapes, including land owned by beginning and previously unengaged forest owners, in order to maintain forest health; protect forests from natural threats and wildfire; enhance public benefits from forests; conserve and manage working forest landscapes for multiple values and uses; and advance priorities in statewide forest assessment and resource strategies. To become eligible to receive a grant, an applicant shall submit to USDA, through the state forester or appropriate state agency, a state and private forest landscape-scale restoration proposal (that includes specified criteria) based on a restoration strategy that[/INST]

This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:  I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough summary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said...  Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.  Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has been ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to people like Koresh.

   Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree of elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal.  As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.  Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with CAH needs to be treated.  ======================================[/INST]

Strengthening Student Aid for All Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to increase the maximum annual and aggregate unsubsidized Stafford loan amounts that may be provided to undergraduate students under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. Allows parents of dependent students to defer PLUS FFEL principal repayment until such students cease to be enrolled as undergraduates on at least a half-time basis. Directs the Secretary of Education to act as the secondary market of last resort for FFELs, until July 2009, by purchasing such loans from lenders who cannot sell them in the private financial markets and thereby raise the capital needed to make new loans. Permits the Secretary to act in such capacity after such date if economic conditions threaten timely, uninterrupted access to student loans. Changes title IV need analyses by allowing the calculation of a negative expected family contribution. Increases the Pell Grant available to students whose expected family contribution is a negative number. Allows institutions of higher education (IHEs) to participate in the FFEL lender-of-last-resort program, thereby requiring guaranty agencies serving as lenders of last resort to make FFELs to students of such IHEs regardless of their ability to otherwise obtain such loans. Authorizes the Secretary to advance needed funds to guaranty agencies acting as lenders of last resort in such situations.[/INST]

The  time I saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped.  When I saw it at they bleeped ""ass.""  Mitch Williams talked about the team being a bunch of  throwaways from other teams, and that is why they are so close.  Kruk said that they all get along this year.

Protect Our Workers from Exploitation and Retaliation Act or the POWER Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to exclude from the definition of ""immigrant"" under such Act a nonimmigrant alien who files a petition for status if the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) determines that the alien: (1) has suffered abuse or harm as a result of having been a victim of criminal activity; (2) has suffered substantial abuse or harm related to specified labor or employment violations related to a workplace claim (workplace violation); (3) is a victim of specified criminal activity and would suffer extreme hardship upon removal; (4) has suffered a workplace violation and would suffer extreme hardship upon removal; (5) has been helpful to a local judge, DHS, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Labor, or the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or to other authorities investigating, prosecuting, or seeking civil remedies for workplace violation; or (6) has filed, is a material witness in, or is likely to be helpful in the investigation of, the claim in a workplace violation and reasonably fears, has been threatened with, or has been the victim of, an action involving force, physical restraint, retaliation, or abuse of the immigration or other legal process by the employer in relation to acts underlying or related to the filing of the claim. Authorizes the Secretary to permit an alien to temporarily remain in the United States and grant the alien employment authorization upon determining that the alien: (1) has filed for relief under such provisions; (2) has filed, or is a material witness to, a bona fide workplace claim; and (3) has been helpful to a federal, state, or local law enforcement official, prosecutor, or judge, to DHS, EEOC, the Department of Labor, or NLRB, or to other federal, state, or local authorities investigating, prosecuting, or seeking civil remedies related to the claim.

:  I'm responding at the risk of misreading your response, but I do have to tell  my fellow conservatives to give it up, attacking Reno/Clinton/ATF/FBI.  They may have botched an operation, but they didn't kill anybody who never shot at them first.  David Koresh was a frigging lunatic.  His followers had the  combined I.Q of a Geraldo audience.  The kids probably would have been those fucked up social rejects who go to Freshman dances in high school, never to be seen again (except maybe in the band) until prom, when they show up like  animals boarding the ark.  Then it's bowling till 3 in the morning.....  (WHY....WHY?? did it happen to me??!!)

Domestic Energy Production Protection Act of 2013 - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to submit for analysis by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) a proposed rule or guidance under the Clean Air Act that may reduce the level of energy output in a specified sector before such a rule or guidance may take effect. Defines ""specified sector"" as one of the nine sectors of energy production listed in the document entitled ""Annual Energy Outlook 2013: With Projections to 2040,"" published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in April 2013. Requires the Administrator of OIRA (Administrator), within 90 days of receiving the proposed rule or guidance, to conduct an analysis to determine if such rule or guidance, individually or when combined with another final rule or guidance issued by EPA, will reduce the level of energy output in a specified sector below the level of the prior year. Requires such analysis to include the potential impact of the rule or guidance on energy output in such sectors and any potential job losses over a period of 10 years. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress after making a determination that a proposed rule or guidance would reduce such energy output.

 Sorry, Sherri, but I can't agree with this particular incident.  While I'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples of rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here.  1)  Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls. So have pitchers and catchers.  Usually, nothing happens. Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations.  2)  It's not as if Gant was ""in Hirschbeck's face"".  Gant said something about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away from Hirschbeck.  As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but with a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call, I'd want a moment or two out of the box, if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch.  And if I was really angry at the ump, I'd rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed, especially at a key moment in the game.  When Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant[/INST]

Directs the U.S. government to seek to implement: (1) an energy crisis initiative that will promote national and regional measures to respond to temporary energy supply disruptions; (2) an energy sustainability initiative to facilitate long-term supply security by fostering reliable supply sources of fuels, including energy from biomass; and (3) an energy for development initiative to promote energy access for underdeveloped areas through energy policy and infrastructure development. Directs the Secretary to seek Western Hemisphere governments' cooperation in establishing a Western Hemisphere Energy Industry Group, which shall increase public-private partnerships and foster private investment. Directs the U.S. government to explore the establishment of the Oil and Gas Working Group, which should strengthen oil- and natural gas-related dialogue among international oil companies, national oil companies, and civil society groups.

      Okay, I see smilies, so this isn't supposed to be a serious post. On the other hand, I would suppose it does has some motivation behind it. Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion, but there is  presumably some sort of reasoning behind it. As an argument, this  statement is worthless. Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious  text (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for  disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.  I've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made between two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam, which doesn't presume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficient clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of Islam. This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have disagreements about _all_ issues relevant to Islam. [/INST]

   This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a game-winning hit.  The ""clutch pitching"" quoted above is something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher.    Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points, standard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league, just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.  And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year, probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past.

News: ===== For the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player remaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not  a major part of the team.   Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has also scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles.   Thoughts on Game 1: ==================  The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with Los Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that was the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and  try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky Kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren Rychel's face into the dasher[/INST]

  I don't know about the paranoia and irrationality, but the rest is pretty close, all though you left out the inability to breath.  Of course you can make a claim that people will do some fairly deranged things to get away from it.  I've seen teenagers flatten 200lb. drill sergeants to get out of tents full of it.  Which raises another issue....   What they didn't mention is that IN THE OPEN, it probably wouldn't do TOO MUCH harm to children, although I wouldn't use it in close proximity to infants.  On the other hand, IN CONFINED spaces, the effects are GREATLY intensified, to the point of LETHALITY, since a sufficient quantity of CS will displace OXYGEN.  When running a CS chamber CAREFUL attention is paid to ventilation.  I wonder if they checked to see if any of the BDs were asthmatics or suffered from other respiratory diseases.  I doubt it.

A tax is considered discriminatory if it is applicable to the rental of motor vehicles or to motor vehicle businesses or property, but not to the majority of other rentals of tangible personal property or businesses within a state or locality. The bill allows a person who is aggrieved by a discriminatory tax to bring a civil action in a U.S. district court for damages, injunctive relief, other legal or equitable relief, or declaratory relief.[/INST]

Stop Child Summer Hunger Act of 2014 - Amends the Richard B.

Defines an ""eligible household"" as a household that includes one or more children who are eligible to receive free or reduced price meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs. Sets the amount on each summer EBT card at $150 per child in 2016, with adjustments thereafter reflecting changes in reimbursement rates for school meals under the school lunch program. Requires children to be enrolled in the program without further application if they are enrolled to receive free or reduced price meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs. Requires summer EBT cards to be used only to purchase food from retail food stores that have been approved for participation in the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program).

  Now *this* is a legitimate point.  Baseball is entertainment, and I have no quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than others, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the slug-bunt; I doubt it's a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of it.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.  Of course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga's inability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he ""isn't paid to walk"" or ""is an RBI guy"" or whatever.   I'm not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becoming convinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot.

Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments of 2014 - Amends laws governing the ability of Indian tribes to develop energy resources located on tribal lands Title I: Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments - (Sec. 101) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to require the Department of the Interior to: (1) consult with an Indian tribe before adopting or approving a well spacing program that affects its energy resources, (2) provide tribes with technical assistance in planning their energy resource development programs, and (3) work with the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs of the Department of Energy (DOE) in establishing the Indian energy resource development program. Makes intertribal organizations eligible for DOE Indian Energy Education Planning and Management Assistance Program grants to manage energy development and efficiency programs. Makes tribal energy development organizations eligible for DOE energy development loan guarantees. (Sec. 102) Requires Interior to make scientific and technical information and expertise available to tribal energy development organizations (in addition to Indian tribes) when issuing energy resource development grants. (Sec. 103) Amends provisions relating to tribal energy resource agreements. States that leases or business agreements entered into by tribes for energy resource development may include construction or operation of facilities that: (1) produce electricity from renewable resources located on tribal land, or (2) process or refine energy resources if a portion has been developed on or produced from tribal land. Allows leases and business agreements that pool, unitize, or communitize a tribe's energy resources with energy resources of other parties. Provides that a lease or business agreement between the Indian tribe and a tribal energy development organization, that is majority owned and controlled by the Indian tribe does not require review and approval by Interior if the lease or business agreement was executed in accordance with specified procedures and does not exceed 30 years or 10 years for an oil and gas lease if oil and gas is produced in paying quantities. Provides that rights-of-way granted by Indian tribes: (1) may include facilities that produce electricity from renewable resources, and (2) do not require review or approval by Interior if specified conditions are met. Alters the process and conditions for Interior's approval of tribal energy resource agreements. Requires Interior to disapprove the agreement only if: (1) the tribe has failed to demonstrate capacity, (2) the agreement would violate federal law or a treaty of the Indian tribe, or (3) the agreement fails to include provisions required by law, such as establishing an environmental review process or allowing for periodic reviews by Interior. Revises the process for determining tribal capacity for an agreement. Requires Interior to determine whether the tribe has sufficient capacity to regulate the development of one or more of the specific energy resources identified for development under the agreement. Requires Interior to consider Indian tribes to have demonstrated capacity if: (1) the tribe has successfully carried out a contract or compact under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act for three consecutive years involving the management of the environment, tribal land, realty, or natural resources; (2) the tribe has carried out approval of surface leases under the Long-Term Leasing Act without a finding of a compliance violation; or (3) Interior fails to make a determination within the required time period. States that a tribe may determine any mitigation measures required for an agreement and permits a tribe to identify categorical exclusions from the environmental review process. Revises the process for interested parties to challenge a tribe's compliance with an agreement. Requires the party to demonstrate with substantial evidence that the party would sustain an adverse environmental impact due to a tribe's noncompliance with an agreement. Authorizes a tribe to amend an agreement to assume authority over another energy resource and requires Interior to promulgate regulations implementing the process and requirements for the amendment. Requires Interior to provide funding to tribes in an amount equal to savings the United States will realize as a result of the tribe carrying out the agreement. Sets forth certification requirements for tribal energy development organizations. (Sec. 104) Directs DOE to collaborate with the Directors of the National Laboratories in making the full array of DOE technical and scientific resources available for tribal energy activities and projects. (Sec. 106) Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct DOE to award competitive grants to assist Indian tribes in implementing strategies to: (1) develop alternative and renewable energy resources and, (2) increase energy efficiency. Gives priority to projects that: (1) increase energy efficiency and conservation, rather than generate new energy; (2) integrate cost-effective renewable energy with energy efficiency; (3) are ready for implementation; (4) clearly articulate and demonstrate the ability to achieve measurable goals; (5) have the potential to make an impact in the government buildings, infrastructure, communities, and land of a tribe; and (6) maximize the creation or retention of jobs on Indian land. Title II: Miscellaneous Amendments - (Sec. 201) Amends the Federal Power Act to provide Indian tribes with the preferences that states and municipalities currently receive when preliminary permits or original licenses are issued for hydroelectric projects. (Sec. 202) Amends the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 to establish a biomass demonstration project for federally recognized Indian tribes and Alaska Native corporations to promote biomass energy production. Specifies procedures and requirements for the projects. (Sec. 203) Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to provide weatherization grants directly to Indian tribes. (Sec. 204) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to allow Interior, an affected Indian tribe, or a certified third-party appraiser to appraise Indian mineral or energy resources involved in a transaction requiring Interior's approval. Requires Interior to review and accept or reject the appraisal within 45 days. (Sec. 205) Amends the Long-Term Leasing Act to authorize the Navajo Nation to enter into a lease for the exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral resources without the approval of Interior, if the lease is executed under tribal regulations approved by Interior and meets specified term limits. Authorizes the Navajo Nation to enter into commercial or agricultural leases of up to 99 years on their restricted lands without Interior's approval if the leases are executed under tribal regulations approved by Interior. (Currently, the leases may not exceed 25 years but may include an option to renew for up to 2 additional terms, neither of which may exceed 25 years.) (Sec. 206) Allows the Crow Tribe of Montana to enter into leases on its restricted land for a term of up to 99 years. (Sec. 207) Requires Interior, at the request of an Indian tribe or individual Indian, to hold in trust any advance payments, bid deposits, or other earnest money received in connection with the review and approval of a sale, lease, permit, or any other conveyance of any interest in any trust or restricted land of any Indian tribe or individual Indian.[/INST]

     Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed replacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.  If the alternative was replacement level, then I think it would've been very close, and yes, Morris might've made the difference.  If the alternative was Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with Viola.   Yes.  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented  the team from collapsing in August.   Those innings were probably helpful.   Well, I think is complete bs.

Native American Energy Act (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to allow the Department of the Interior, an affected Indian tribe, or a certified third-party appraiser under contract with the Indian tribe to appraise Indian land or trust assets involved in a transaction requiring Interior approval. (Currently, Interior sets appraisal requirements.) Interior must approve or disapprove an appraisal within 60 days or the appraisal is deemed approved. A tribe may waive the requirement for an appraisal if it also waives any claims for damages it might have against the United States as a result of the lack of an appraisal. (Sec. 3) Each agency within Interior involved in the review of oil and gas activities on Indian lands must use a uniform system of reference numbers and tracking systems for oil and gas wells. (Sec. 4) This bill amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to make the environmental impact statement for a major federal action (excluding an action related to gaming) on Indian lands available for review and comment only to the affected tribe, individuals residing within the affected area, and state, tribal, and local governments within the affected area. (Sec. 5) This bill sets forth provisions for the judicial review of a cause of action related to energy development on Indian land. (Sec. 6) This bill amends the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 to direct Interior, for land under Bureau of Land Management jurisdiction, and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), for land under Forest Service jurisdiction, to enter into agreements with Indian tribes to carry out demonstration projects that promote biomass energy production on Indian forest land and in nearby communities by providing tribes with reliable supplies of woody biomass from federal lands. Interior and USDA may carry out demonstration projects by which tribes may perform the functions of programs under the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004. (Sec. 7) Activity pursuant to a tribal resource management plan or an integrated resource management plan approved by Interior under the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act or the American Indian Agricultural Resource Management Act is considered to be a sustainable management practice. (Sec. 8) This bill amends the Long-Term Leasing Act to allow the Navajo Nation to enter into mineral resource leases on their restricted lands without Interior's approval. The maximum term of a Navajo Nation lease that does not require Interior's approval is extended for commercial and agricultural leases and established for mineral resource leases. (Sec. 9) Interior rules regarding hydraulic fracturing do not apply on land held in trust for Indians or on restricted Indian land, except with the express consent of the Indian beneficiaries. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a process to extract underground resources such as oil or gas from a geologic formation by injecting water, a propping agent (e.g., sand), and chemical additives into a well under enough pressure to fracture the geological formation.[/INST]

  This was reported in Canadian papers Thursday, 22 April - I _think_ the source was UPI, but don't recall for certain.    I understand that at least two goverment investigations have been ordered, so we may learn more during their hearings.    Tough call without more investigation, but if the thermal imaging story holds up, I think the government will be more credable... of course, paranoia fans won't believe their results anyway, will they?   Hear, hear! I'd also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports that multiple victims were found shot (in the head), and in positions inconsistent with fire victims. It is simply too early to draw conclusions either way about this nasty incident, but I tend to believe the government side. [/INST]

(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2016 (Sec. 2) This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise a specified regulation to create a safe harbor for certain publications or distributions of research reports by brokers or dealers distributing securities. The revised regulation shall declare that a published or distributed investment fund research report shall not be deemed to constitute an offer for sale or an offer to sell a security that is the subject of the offering pursuant to an effective registration statement, even if the broker or dealer is participating or will participate in the registered offering of the covered investment fund's securities. The covered investment fund research report shall indeed be deemed to satisfy the regulation's requirements as well as those of any self-regulatory organization. The SEC shall not impose specified conditions and requirements when implementing the safe harbor. Until the SEC has adopted such safe harbor revisions, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has revised a related rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security listed on a national securities exchange that is not subject to a certain filing requirement of the Investment Company Act of 1940.[/INST]

 I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955.  There  is a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in the groin.  The bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then entered the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  Later,  when she (a young woman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did the honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they lived happily ever after.   Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would come into class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from about 3/8"" to 1/2"" over a 10 inch length).  He would say, ""Boys, do you know what this is?  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's used to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up there without an anesthetic!""  Needless to say this had a chilling effect. I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.

 As she said, the letter is addressed to Bettman.  The post (which, though having pretty much the same content, is an entirely different entity) was addressed to all.  When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will say ""To: All"".  I figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here.  That's an entirely  different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman.  Unfortunately...    The ""largest computer networks in the world"" phrase is a definition of  the Internet, not a group as a whole that she claims to represent.

Know Before You Owe Private Student Loan Act of 2012 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require a lender, before issuing a private education loan for a student attending an institution of higher education (IHE), to obtain the IHE's certification of: (1) the student's enrollment status, (2) the student's cost of attendance, and (3) the difference between that cost and the student's estimated financial assistance. Eliminates the requirement that such lenders obtain a self-certification form from the private education loan applicant. Allows a lender to issue such loan without a certification if there is no response from the relevant IHE within 15 business days of the lender's request for the certification. Requires private educational lenders to: (1) send loan statements to borrowers at least once every month a student is enrolled at an IHE; (2) notify the relevant IHE, in writing, of the loan amount and the student to whom it applies no later than the date funds are issued; and (3) submit an annual report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) containing information the CFPB requires concerning private student loans. Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require IHEs, before providing lenders with certifications, to determine whether students have exhausted their options for title IV assistance and notify borrowers of: (1) the availability of such assistance; (2) their ability to choose their own private educational lender; (3) the impact of the proposed private education loan on their eligibility for other financial assistance; and (4) their right to accept or reject a private education loan within 30 days of the lender's approval of their application, and to cancel the loan within 3 business days of its consummation.[/INST]

[snip]....          Excellent point, Mark.  We should all remember that if Nixon  hadn't tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of his  subordinates in the Watergate burglary, the scandal would  never have brought down his presidency.  So far, Klinton seems  to be stonewalling this the same way Tricky Dick did.  His whole  case seems to be ""we didn't do anything wrong"".  However, if  in the course of the investigation it turns out that the  gov't DID do something wrong, and he tried to cover it up,  then that's an impeachable crime, I believe...     Perhaps he is inadvertently cooking up his own scandal...  Can you   say ""Wacogate"", little neighbor?...   ;-)  [/INST]

TITLE I--HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS (Sec. 101) This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to terminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provides for investment in prevention and public health programs to improve health and restrain the rate of growth in health care costs. Unobligated funds are rescinded. (Sec. 102) Funding for community health centers is increased. (Sec. 103) Certain funding for U.S. territories that establish health insurance exchanges is no longer available after 2017. (Sec. 104) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may not collect fees or make payments under the transitional reinsurance program. (Sec. 105) This bill makes appropriations for FY2016 and FY2017 for HHS to award grants to states to address substance abuse or to respond to urgent mental health needs. TITLE II--FINANCE (Sec. 201) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require individuals to pay back the full amount of advance payments in excess of their premium assistance tax credit. (Currently, there is a limit on the amount of excess an individual must pay back.) (Sec. 202) Provisions relating to the premium assistance tax credit, reduced cost-sharing, and eligibility determinations for these subsidies are repealed on December 31, 2017. (Sec. 203) The small employer health insurance tax credit does not apply after 2017. (This credit is for certain employers who make contributions toward employee health coverage purchased through a health insurance exchange.) (Sec. 204) The penalty for individuals who do not maintain minimum essential health care coverage is eliminated. (Sec. 205) Large employers are no longer required to make shared responsibility payments. (Sec. 206) For one year, this bill restricts the availability of federal funding to a state for payments to an entity (e.g., Planned Parenthood Federation of America) that: is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization; is an essential community provider primarily engaged in family planning services and reproductive health; provides for abortions other than abortions in cases of rape or incest, or where a physical condition endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed; and received a total of more than $350 million under Medicaid in FY2014, including payments to affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, or clinics. (Sec. 207) This bill amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to require the additional payments to U.S. territories for Medicaid under the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 to be made by the end of FY2017 instead of the end of FY2019. This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the SSAct to end the expansion of Medicaid under PPACA on December 31, 2017. After 2017, hospitals may no longer elect to provide Medicaid services to individuals during a presumptive eligibility period. States must maintain Medicaid eligibility standards for individuals under 19 years old through FY2017 instead of through FY2019. The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP, the federal matching rate for Medicaid expenditures) for U.S. territories is 50% after 2017 (currently, the FMAP is 55%). The increased FMAP for childless adults and home and community-based attendant services under PPACA ends December 31, 2017. After 2017, states may no longer elect to provide certain individuals with a presumptive eligibility period for Medicaid. Medicaid benchmark plans are no longer required to provide minimum essential health benefits after 2017. After 2017, states are no longer required to operate a website for Medicaid enrollment that is linked to the state's health benefit exchange and Children's Health Insurance program (CHIP). (Sec. 208) Medicaid allotments for disproportionate share hospitals are increased. (Sec. 209) The excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage (popularly known as the ""Cadillac tax"") does not apply after 2017. (Sec. 210) Health savings accounts (HSAs), Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs), health flexible spending arrangements (HFSAs), and health reimbursement arrangements may be used to pay for over-the-counter medications. (Sec. 211) This bill lowers the tax on distributions from HSAs and Archer MSAs that are not used for medical expenses. (Sec. 212) Salary reduction contributions to an HFSA under a cafeteria plan are no longer limited. (Sec. 213) The annual fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs is eliminated. (Sec. 214) The excise tax on medical devices is eliminated. (Sec. 215) The annual fee on health insurers is eliminated. (Sec. 216) Medical costs are allowed as a tax deduction regardless of whether the costs are taken into account when determining the amount of the subsidy for an employer-sponsored retiree prescription drug plan under Medicare part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program). (Sec. 217) A tax deduction is allowed for medical expenses in excess of 7.5% (currently, 10%) of adjusted gross income. (Sec. 218) The additional Medicare tax on income above a certain threshold is eliminated. (Sec. 219) The indoor tanning services tax is eliminated. (Sec. 220) The net investment income tax is eliminated. (Sec. 221) A health insurer is allowed a tax deduction for the full amount of an employee's compensation. (Currently, there is a limit on the amount of an employee's compensation that a health insurer may deduct.) (Sec. 222) Provisions relating to the economic substance doctrine are repealed. (The economic substance doctrine treats a transaction as having economic substance if it has a purpose other than reducing income taxes. Currently, there are penalties for claiming tax benefits for transactions without economic substance.) (Sec. 223) Funds are transferred from the Department of the Treasury to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.[/INST]

Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems:  First, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it, the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular, if I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food, food occasionally gets ""stuck"" before reaching my stomach. This results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction. Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying, and causes frequent discomfort.  My doctor wants to ""dilate"" the ring using the following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so, was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on safety, advisability, and success[/INST]

Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the tax treatment of certain life insurance contract transactions, to require reporting to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of: (1) information identifying persons who acquire a life insurance contract, or any interest therein, in a reportable policy sale; (2) information identifying a seller who transfers an interest in a life insurance contract and the seller's investment in the contract; and (3) reportable death benefit payments.

 Perhaps you have a different understanding of what ""physics"" is.  If we can't measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics aren't objective either.  That's what I mean when I say there's no objective physics.  Sure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that's maths.  It's only physics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can't do that objectively, we're stuck.  (Of course, this displays my blatant bias towards applied science; but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real world situations, based on real world observations.)   It's an axiom that it's invariant.  But if the two of us measure it, we'll get different answers.  Yes, we call that experimental error, but it's not really ""error"" in the conventional sense; in fact, if you don't get any, that's an error :-)  You could argue that the value of c is ""objective, to within +/- <some value>"".  But I'd call that a rather odd usage of the word ""objective"", and it opens the way for statements like ""Murder is objectively wrong for all people, to within 1% of the[/INST]

Last night, Sid Fernandez was mowing the Giants hitters down (14 Ks in 8 innings), yet the first 7 1/2 innings of the game were quite brisk.

You want to speed up ballgames?  1.  Enforce the two minutes between innings.  As it is, many fields are     allowing THREE minutes between them.  Fifteen seconds before      TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon     the return to the game.  Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or     a ball is called.  2.  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it.  They may get     pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher     throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.  3.

Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Home Ownership Act of 2012 or HEARTH Act of 2012 - Extends to any Indian tribe the discretion granted under current law only to the Navajo Nation to lease restricted lands for business, agricultural, public, religious, educational, recreational, or residential purposes without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. (The Secretary must still approve the tribal regulations under which those leases are executed and mining leases still require the Secretary's approval.) Sets forth the environmental review process required under tribal lease regulations before those regulations obtain the Secretary's approval. Requires the process to identify and evaluate any significant effects a proposed lease may have on the environment and allow public comment on those effects. Authorizes the Secretary to provide a tribe, upon the tribe's request, with technical assistance in developing a regulatory environmental review process. Allows tribes to rely on a federal environmental review process rather than the tribal environmental review process if the project under review is federally funded. Directs the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to report to Congress on the history and experience of Indian tribes that have chosen to assume the BIA's responsibility for operating the Indian Land Title and Records Office.[/INST]

Medicaid and SCHIP Beneficiary Choice Improvement Act of 2009 - Amends title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program) (SCHIP, also known as CHIP) of the Social Security Act to require an SCHIP plan to describe how it will provide for child health assistance with respect to targeted low-income children who have access to coverage under a group health plan. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to pay to each state with an approved SCHIP plan a certain amount for the payment of premiums for coverage under an employer-sponsored group health plan that includes coverage of targeted low-income children and benefits supplemental to such coverage. Revises requirements regarding the purchase of employer-sponsored insurance. Prohibits any minimum benefits requirement or any limitation on beneficiary cost-sharing. Declares that, if the basic coverage of such insurance does not extend to each of certain categories of basic services, the plan shall cover such services as supplemental benefits. Prohibits a plan from requiring a targeted low-income child to enroll in family coverage in order to obtain child health assistance. Requires an annual voluntary enrollment period for switching from one plan to another. Requires the offering of alternative coverage options under SCHIP. Prescribes requirements for federal financial participation for qualified alternative coverage. Declares that the requirements imposed under a state child health plan under this Act shall apply in the same manner to a state plan under title XIX (Medicaid), except that: (1) such requirements shall not apply to individuals whose Medicaid eligibility is based on being aged, blind, or disabled or to individuals in certain categories; and (2) the national per capita expenditures shall be determined based on a specified benchmark coverage but without regard to expenditures for such excluded individuals or for nursing facility services and other long-term care (LTC) services. Amends the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 to repeal the prohibition against the Secretary's approval of any new health opportunity account demonstration programs.

The bill directs the NRC to ensure the collection of fees is equal to their budget authority.The NRC is authorized to collect fees through: (1)fees for services that specifically benefit a particular person or entity, and (2)annual fees to fund regulatory costs.The bill places a cap on the amount of annual fee that may be charged to an operating reactor.The NRC may waive the cap for one-year. Performance metrics and milestone schedules must be developed for activities requested by applicants and licensees to improve transparency and accountability.In addition, the NRC must implement processes to ensure accurate invoicing. (Sec.7)The NRC must establish stages within the licensing process for reactorsand implement risk-informed performance-based licensing evaluation techniques and guidance.Research and test reactor licensing must also be developed.In addition, the NRC must complete a rulemaking by the end of 2023 to establish a technology-inclusive regulatory framework for licensing advanced nuclear reactors. The NRC is also directed to train staff and develop the expertise required to implement stages within the licensing process. The NRC must report to Congress on: (1) the implementation of stages in the licensing process, and (2) the use of risk-informed and performance-based techniques within the existing regulatory framework.

In <faUk03m6d0Kq00@amdahl.uts.amdahl.com>,  dated 29 Apr 93 15:43:10 GMT,  I'll agree with your wife.  While I was a student, I had doctors remove rather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple times, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, and said something like ""Gee, you've got a lot of wax in there"".  In my case, removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, and I've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy little bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store - I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.[/INST]

 This was a concession to Mansbridge and CBC News, they argued that if you're going to play  havoc with the schedule, you should  at least make sure that Prime Time is aired as soon as possible. News got a commitment that the post-game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within one minute or so of the game  ending.  As for the earlier comments about CBC being ""Ontariocentric"" frankly the no doubleheader decison goes both ways, people in the West cant  see the Leafs  and people in Central Canada can't see the Jets game. The reason for the decision was CBC's feeling they couldn't sell advertising for six hours of hockey in  one night.   As for who wants to see news over hockey, a lot of people. CBC always gets plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule.  [/INST]

  I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the world is flat.  However, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in  voluntarly actions. I don't think Plato would have been happy with this, and neither would Paul, although Paul's ideas were quite different. However, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not just preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in favour of these statements.  The same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature. I don't believe in spirits, devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.   Ah, you said it. You believe what you want to. This is what I had assumed all along.    You might be as well planting Satan's seeds, ever thought of this? Besides, you haven't yet explained why we must believe so[/INST]

Agency Accountability Act of 2016 This bill requires any agency that receives a fee, fine, penalty, or proceeds from a settlement to deposit the amount in the general fund of the Treasury. The funds may not be used unless the funding is provided in advance in an appropriations bill. Any amounts deposited during the fiscal year in which this bill is enacted may not be obligated during the fiscal year and must be used for deficit reduction. The bill amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to require offsetting receipts and collections to be treated as revenue. (Offsetting receipts and collections are funds collected by agencies from other government accounts or from the public in businesslike or market-oriented transactions. Under current law, the collections are treated as negative budget authority and outlays rather than revenue and may be used to offset spending for budget enforcement purposes.) The requirements of the bill do not apply to the U.S. Postal Service or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and the Director of the USPTO must submit annually to Congress a report describing any fee, fine, penalty, or proceeds from a settlement collected by the USPTO during the previous year.[/INST]

  I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let's give credit where credit is due.  It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris. Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the  other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly). Also, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series.  His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs) and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of 6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good as he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters ""get themseleves out"" (I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear[/INST]

Responsible GSE Affordable Housing Investment Act of 2010 - Amends the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 to revise requirements for determination of compliance with the multifamily special affordable housing goal. Requires the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish standards for the multifamily special affordable housing goal that proportionately reduce the number of units receiving credit for any mortgage purchase by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) (government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs) that facilitates the conversion of dwelling units available at rental rates affordable to low-income families to dwelling units such families could not afford. Requires such standards to provide no credit toward achievement of the goal for any mortgage purchase for multifamily housing that involves an aggregate amount of project debt that is not reasonable. Requires the Director to require the GSE to apply this same standard to any mortgages backing any GSE-purchased security to determine whether the units financed by such mortgages are eligible for credit toward achievement of the housing goal.[/INST]

  If in said situation. I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported on in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action is as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a  weapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!) and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile  action he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!) Repeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking gun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and I will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's  ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops!

So who brainwashed YOU into believing that whatever the government says it the truth?  Or that Koresh was any actual threat to you and the rest of the  US?  Haven't you ever stopped to wonder WHY the government raided this farm? This raid was NOT ABOUT RELIGION, SEX, OR CHILD ABUSE.  To the best available evidence at the moment, this raid, psychological torture, and group death was  about Koresh's failure to PAY A $200 TAX on ONE grenade launcher that he may  or may not even have had!  That's why it was the BATF doing the raiding in the first place.  Do you think a $200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government with 100 armed men in trailers, orchestrated character assassination, noise torture, and a holocaust?   Then think[/INST]

Fair Employment Opportunity Act of 2014 - Declares it an unlawful practice for certain employers with at least 15 employees for each working day in each of at least 20 calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year to: (1) refuse to consider or offer employment to an individual based on present or past unemployment regardless of the length of time such individual was unemployed, (2) publish an advertisement or announcement for any job with provisions indicating that such an unemployed status disqualifies an individual and that an employer will not consider an applicant based on such status, and (3) direct or request that an employment agency account for such status when screening or referring applicants. Prohibits an employment agency (including agents and persons maintaining a website publishing job advertisements or announcements), based on such an individual's status as unemployed, from: (1) refusing to consider or refer an individual for employment; (2) limiting, segregating, or classifying individuals in any manner limiting access to job information; or (3) publishing an advertisement or announcement for any job vacancy that includes provisions indicating that such an individual is disqualified and that an employer will not consider such individuals. Allows consideration of an individual's status as unemployed where an individual's employment in a similar or related job for a period of time reasonably proximate to the hiring of such individual is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to successful performance of the job being filled. Authorizes, subject to termination upon the filing of certain complaints by the Secretary of Labor, one or more persons for and in behalf of the affected individual, or the affected individual and other individuals similarly situated, to bring actions in federal or state court for specified actual damages and equitable relief including employment and compensatory and punitive damages. Directs the Secretary to: (1) receive, investigate, and attempt to resolve complaints according to specified provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; and (2) pay directly to each affected individual applicable sums recovered in any civil actions brought by the Secretary under this Act.

 This is where Freeman's love of accuracy becomes really ridiculous.  [his point was that it is possible under certain circumstances for many people to carry concealed in Illinois] I did read the law before I commented on it.  Judging from replies I received about my ""Semantics on t.p.g"" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g assume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one.  It would also follow that said person would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or business.     Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  The thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.

Friend's unpleasant experience uring CT scan deleted  I'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to the hospital administrator. Specify the date and time. If possible the names of the technicians.   Send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was admitted. I say this because, though your friend has no argument with the doctor, I have found that administrators sometimes ignore complaints until the patient becomes litigious. Clinicians may not have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find themselves named in a suit.  If there is no response within a week send a follow up letter. Attach a photocopy of the original letter. Do this weekly until you do get a response.  CAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary. The scanner can be a bad place for the claustrophobic. There was an interesting study in the BMJ, about 10 years ago, which found that around 10% of people who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would never have another. This compares with 15% who said the same about a lumbar puncture. [/INST]

     Yes, but   (a) we were talking about peak level, not career averages and  (b) Clemente was the best fielding RF of all time, as far      as anyone can tell  I did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak comparable to or better than Winfield.  In my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement, you could make good cases for Ruth, Aaron, Ott, Robinson, Clemente, Kaline,  Maris, Klein, Jackson, Waner, and probably a few others.  This is not a knock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other players had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while Winfield has been more uniformly excellent.

Manufactured Housing Energy Efficiency Act This bill amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to revise requirements governing when the Department of Energy (DOE) must update energy conservation standards for residential manufactured housing, commonly known as mobile homes. Currently, DOE's energy conservation standards for such housing are based on the most recent version of the model International Energy Conservation Code and DOE must update the standards within a year of a revision to the code, unless the code is not cost-effective, or a more stringent standard would be more cost-effective. The bill requires DOE to make a determination on whether updating its energy conservation standards based on the revised code would improve energy efficiency in manufactured housing before updating those standards. The Department of Housing and Urban Development must: (1) administer and enforce the energy conservation standards established by this bill, and (2) make public each year aggregate information on enforcement actions with respect to those standards.[/INST]

This syringe was intended to be used with a special trocar for injecting ferric chloride into aneurysms, and thus to heal them by coagulation.  1853.  Alexander Wood (1817-84)  of Edinburgh invents the hypodermic needle and adapts Pravaz's syringe for use with it.""

  Diplomatic :-)  I realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument, so I'll try to explain why I feel a mind is necessary.   Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They're great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not at working out the method itself.  As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks. Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program them into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, and write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see, the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material, much of which isn't used.  One[/INST]

Coverage Protection Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), in the case of an individual who enrolls in a qualified health plan offered through a health care exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) before February 1, 2014, to require the issuer of the plan to treat such individual as enrolled as of December 23, 2013, if the individual: attests, not later than January 31, 2014, to making reasonable, good-faith attempts to successfully enroll in such a plan through an exchange before December 23, 2013, or was initially determined through an exchange to be eligible to enroll in a Medicaid plan but is not eligible to so enroll in such a plan and, because of the incorrect eligibility determination, was subsequently unable to enroll in a qualified plan before December 23, 2013; and pays, not later than January 31, 2014, the monthly premiums for the plan in which such individual enrolls for January and February 2014, taking into account the amount of any premium assistance made available under the Internal Revenue Code.

   If I prescribe itraconazole for a patient's sinusitis neither the AMA, FDA, State Licensing Board, nor ABFP will be knocking on my door to ask why.  This is a specious argument.   Among other things, how to evaluate new theories and treatments.   Funny, I thought it meant ""one who fraudulently misrepresents his ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers"" (Dorland's 27th).  Certainly more precision than conveyed by ""chronic yeast"".   The inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous representations is far more frightening.  It is fraud to promote a treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it and the quacksalver knows so, or error if the honest practitioner doesn't know so.  Failure to speak out against either bespeaks incompetency.   May I reply - seriously - that if the practitioners and proponents of non-scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out, they should learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing hierarchy and divisions.[/INST]

 It was NOT Krupp's skate.  Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle, of the Blues.  They both sort of tripped and fell toward Malarchuk, and Tuttle's skate came perilously close to cutting (but actually just missed) the jugular.  Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice, hands at his neck, blood on the ice.  He'd been suffering from it for over a decade.  He just wasn't diagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to have some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he'd just been put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  It's amazing he lasted as long as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between reality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they've checked is OK now.  For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands over and over and still think they're dirty.  He might check the oven ten times to be sure it's turned off.  He might see a movie about something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his own life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes, but still needs it. [/INST]

   Precisely my position.      As a newbie, I tried the point-by-point approach to debate with   these types.  It wasted both my time and my lifespan.

: Hi there, :  : I'm german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now. : There are many problems occuring for me. One of them is the ERA statistic for : pitchers. What does it say ??  ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned run, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA is 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.   ERA = (ER/IP) * 9  An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented the third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs. Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:   If there are two outs in[/INST]

  there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents.    Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under.  I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents. What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths? I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a justification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem?  I assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.    My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.[/INST]

Relay of coverage seen: ---------------------- There was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier  today (Wednesday).  It was explained that two news photographers were found  on the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained  to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer  turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous  by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)    The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and  the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.   It was also emphasized that the survey of the ""crime"" scene at this  point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere. The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the  site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.

    Then by your logic, the Jews in Europe in the 1930's were the cause for the Holocaust.  Hitler told them to leave and because they didn't they brought the whole thing on themselves.  Because as you say, they could have COME OUT of Germany.     Same for the Jews in Europe 1930's.   You don't see any evidence of the abuse -- therefore it must be taking place? As you point out everwhere but here, it is irrelevant to this case.  The ATF is not in charge of investigating child abuse.    In obvious contradiction to the statements made by the F. B. I.

My ENT doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses.  I have a very deviated nasal septum (probably the result at least partially from several fractures). One side has approximately 10-15% of normal flow.  Of course I have known this for years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection, discovered during an MRI after a severe migraine.  A CT scan subsequently  confirmed the problems in the sinuses.  He wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid, maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid, along with nasal septoplasty.  He explained the procedure, and the risks.  What I would like to know is if there is anyone out there who can tell me ""I had this surgery, and it helped me""?  (I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't really help them).  I am a moderately severe asthmatic.  ENT doc says large percentage see some relief of their asthma after sinus surgery.  Also he said it is not unheard of that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved.  I am 42.  Any relevant information is appreciated.  Regards,[/INST]

 THE diarrhea problem?  WHAT diarrhea problem?  First, candidal overgrowth is not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy, and not all cases of antibiotic-related diarrhea have anything to do with candida.  But a case of vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy isn't going to surprise anyone either.  That's not what people are disagreeing with.   Oh, really?  Where'd you come up with this?  You know, it's really appalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters in a bizarre synthesis from reading reports in the literature.

    There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I saw, however propane is interesting stuff.  It doesn't explode on contact with air.  It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to the tank.  Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing the gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere, and maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially semi-rural areas.     This is true, but so far the FBI/BATF track record on this incident is very bad.     I think it would have disarmed many people if the FBI followed this same policy.  They have not.

  I agree with Nick.  What's the big deal about long games?  If you want to watch baseball, there's that much more baseball to watch.  And yes, baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.  I suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games, especially when it's coming from TV people, has to something to do with advertising. Probably time ""wasted"" in the middle of an inning, say by a batter stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves, or by a pitcher walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts, could otherwise be sold as advertising time.[/INST]

    That's the trouble: *what* peak years?  He wavers between excellent and very good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there.  1979 was a fine year; 78 and 80 were merely really good.  With the Yankees, 84 (I think) was the best; that was the one with the .340 BA.    Of course, 1992 wasn't bad, either.  He's been in the bigs since 1973, with a one-year intermission for surgery.  Though he doesn't have the mix of skills that Pete Rose did, he's like Pete Rose in one way: he's  not a natural hitter.  Winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing in New York, and that includes the Gulf+Western Building.  But his sheer athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.

 I believe Acker got a ring from his wife when they were married      I don't know why you guys keep bickering about Morris. The stats show he is a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened to win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good games. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was  constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings) and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor in his 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would leave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win games (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).

   While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around, Gant wasn't ordered back in the box ""sooner"", he was ordered back immediately. As soon as he stepped out, Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box. Now, Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches.  The only reason he did then because he was *very* bothered by the call.  I expect his concentration wasn't there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it's best to be as calm as possible.  Contributing factors would be Gant's bad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring drought.  Now, it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there.  You know the umpire is going to do something (call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.  But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason to want some time (disputed strike call).[/INST]

Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem. It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell curve.  (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting vs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players (as opposed to all baseball players).

But I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm to which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.  As far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right. It's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who just don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At last Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a goaltender can get an assist.  Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen at any time.

(Sec. 3) Exempts: (1) agencies and business entities from notification requirements for national security and law enforcement purposes and for security breaches that a risk assessment concludes do not have a significant risk of resulting in harm if specified certification or notice is provided, which is subject to review by the U.S. Secret Service; and (2) business entities from notification requirements if such an entity utilizes a security program that blocks the use of sensitive personally identifiable information to initiate unauthorized financial transactions and provides notice of a breach to affected individuals. Sets forth a presumption that there was no significant risk of harm to an individual whose sensitive personally identifiable information was subject to a security breach if such information: (1) was encrypted; or (2) was rendered indecipherable through the use of best practices or methods, such as redaction, access controls, or other such mechanisms, that are widely accepted as an effective industry practice, or an effective industry standard.(Sec. 4) Provides that an agency or business entity shall be in compliance with such requirements if it provides both individual notice and media notice.(Sec. 5) Requires notice to include: (1) a description of the categories of sensitive personally identifiable information acquired by an unauthorized person; (2) a toll-free number that the individual may use to contact the agency or business entity to learn what types of personal information the agency or entity maintained; and (3) the toll-free telephone numbers and addresses for the major credit reporting agencies. Authorizes a state to require that a notice also include information regarding victim protection assistance provided by that state.(Sec. 6) Directs an agency or business entity that is required to provide notification to more than 5,000 individuals to also notify all nationwide consumer reporting agencies of the timing and distribution of the notices.(Sec. 7) Requires any business entity or agency to notify the Secret Service of the fact that a security breach has occurred if: (1) the number of individuals whose sensitive personally identifying information was acquired by an unauthorized person exceeds 10,000; (2) the breach involves a data system containing information on more than 1 million individuals nationwide; (3) the breach involves databases owned by the federal government; or (4) the breach involves primarily sensitive personally identifiable information of individuals known to the agency or business entity to be employees and contractors of the federal government involved in national security or law enforcement.Requires notifications regarding security breaches under specified circumstances to the Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and state attorneys general.(Sec. 8) Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action in U.S. district court against any business entity that violates this Act. Sets daily and maximum civil penalties for violations by a business entity.Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require agencies to include a fraud alert in the file of a consumer that submits evidence of compromised financial information to a consumer reporting agency.(Sec. 9) Authorizes civil actions by state attorneys general to enforce this Act. (Sec. 10) Provides that this Act shall not supersede any other provision of federal law or of state law relating to notification by a business entity engaged in interstate commerce or an agency of a security breach.(Sec. 11) Authorizes appropriations for costs incurred by the Secret Service to investigate and conduct risk assessments of security breaches.(Sec. 12) Directs the Secret Service to report to Congress on the number and nature of security breaches: (1) described in the notices filed by those business entities invoking the risk assessment exemption; and (2) subject to the national security and law enforcement exemptions.

Again I assume this is not just flame bait by Roger, but actually a truly held opinion.     Thanks.  For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important enough to say something themselves.    I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong to.  It represents a subset (that you don't belong to) of a larger group (which you do, if only because this isn't a moderated group).  Look, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  Three that come to mind are as follows:  1) Say it subtly.  Result: it may not be clear. 2) Say it directly yet politely.  Result: probably it will spark some     interesting conversation. 3) Say it directly and obnoxiously.  Result: validity goes right out    the window.

  You probably were trying to be facetious but just for the record partial nasal obstruction is correlated with a number of chronic disorders such as migraine, hyperthyroidism, asthma, peptic ulcer, dysmenorrhea, and lack of libido (:-) ) [Riga IN.

 The CLIPPER initiative is an announcement by Clinton that all the  ""secure"" voice phones will use the same crypto chip, as a de-facto government standard.  Problem is, the government is admitting that they hold the keys to break the code easily, and the Justice department will be using the keys to listen in on ""illegal activities.""  Many people are really scared about such an initiative because it is a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things like email if you read the press release.  The project was developed by NSA and given to NIST.  It uses two keys S1 and S2 that the government claims are needed to break the code.  They claim that these keys will be handed to two different companies, and when they get a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip), they have to get the keys from both companies.  People have poked holes through and through the press release official version and shown how it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds, and I have given the simplified version.

Truth, Transparency, Accountability, and Fairness in Trade Act This bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the Department of Labor to make a joint annual report to Congress with the U.S. International Trade Commission on the operation of the trade agreements program during the preceding calendar year, including specified information about each free trade agreement in effect. Any free trade agreement or portion of it that provides for the termination of portions shall cease to be effective with respect to the United States if annual reports on it show as a result of the agreement or a portion of it any: export disruption (declining U.S. exports to, and rising U.S. imports from, a country party to the agreement), either overall or for a specific commodity or industry, in three consecutive calendar years or in three calendar years during a consecutive five-calendar year period; labor disruption (an increase of 5% or more in the number of applications for adjustment assistance for workers and firms), either overall or with respect to a specific good or industry, in each of three consecutive calendar years or in each of three calendar years during a consecutive five-calendar year period; or trade balance disruption (an increase of 5% or more in the U.S. trade deficit in goods with respect to a country party to the agreement) in each of three consecutive calendar years or in each of three calendar years during a consecutive five-calendar year period. A termination bill, relating to such circumstances, must be enacted into law to effect a termination of the free trade agreement or a portion of it. Fast track procedures are prescribed for congressional consideration of a termination bill. The United States Trade Representative shall: take specified enforcement actions against any country party to a free trade agreement if it has implemented a tariff or nontariff barrier by reason of enactment into law of a bill terminating the agreement in whole or in part, and ensure that any free trade agreement entered into on or after enactment of this Act is negotiated in a form that provides for the termination with respect to the United States of specific portions of it.[/INST]

NO SURRENDER! Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993  It is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel threatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are immediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid of. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The stranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The mugger...the rapist.   And what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door locked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and always, there's the implied question ""what's a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you?  But what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10 years to devote learning judo?

 So far, the medical examiner (according to the news) has found NO EVIDENCE of gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined.  If this continues to be the case, it will sort of shoot holes (pun intended) in the FBI story, wouldn't it?  And cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch a bullet like they do when fired from a gun.  The bullet hardly moves, it is the brass casing that goes flying, and then with less than lethal force.  It will hurt, yes, but not KILL you - I doubt if it wil penetrate a coat, for example.  How about an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full subpoena powers, and powers to prosecute on felony charges, to investigate for any possible illegal/criminal activity on the part of both the BATF and FBI?  I cannot see any reason why not - to use the phrase they like to use so often, ""if they have nothing to hide..."" they should welcome it, and vigorously support it.  Note that an internal investigation by the Dept of Justice is NOT an independent investigation... [/INST]

While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it must be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis    Joseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do. Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there  would probably be a game 6 scheduled.    As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt. One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to give them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot for Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis' goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.

This is the AP story from Fri morning.  As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and  checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the     compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.    This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the  six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world     since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's  phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.     They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the women did laundry. Others read[/INST]

You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief just as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone who doesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and therefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what the government says is wrong to be wrong.  David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists, methodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT even though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe the same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment.

Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act of 2010 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require an abortion provider who knowingly performs an abortion of a pain-capable unborn child (defined as an unborn child who has reached a probable stage of development of 20 weeks or more after fertilization), to first: (1) inform the woman of the probable age of the child; (2) provide to the woman an Unborn Child Pain Awareness Brochure (unless she waives receipt); (3) provide information that pain medicine administered to the mother may not prevent pain in the child, but in some cases anesthesia or pain-reducing drugs can be administered directly to the child; (4) give the woman the provider's best medical judgment of the risks and costs of such anesthesia or analgesic; and (5) obtain the woman's signature on the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Decision Form and her explicit request for or refusal of the administration of drugs to the child. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Brochure that includes a statement that there is substantial evidence that the process of being killed in an abortion will cause the unborn child pain and that the mother has the option of having pain-reducing drugs administered directly to the child. Creates an exception to save the life of the mother. Establishes civil penalties for willfully failing to comply with this Act.

 I don't like the term ""quack"" being applied to a licensed physician David. Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion). I'll give you some examples.   1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no      demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.   2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid      function for the purpose of quick weight loss.   3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has      been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by      the NCI.  These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should  not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of  which result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal  agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be  having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of  commission or omission.

 Great start.  I realize immediately that you are not interested in discussion and are going to thump your babble at me.  I would much prefer an answer from Ms Healy, who seems to have a reasonable and reasoned approach to things.  Say, aren't you the creationist guy who made a lot of silly statements about evolution some time ago?   Duh, gee, then we must be talking Christian mythology now.  I was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable, logical person, but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition of the same boring mythology I've seen a thousand times before. I am deleting the rest of your remarks, unless I spot something that approaches an answer, because they are merely a repetition of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought at all.

I'm a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best I can here in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma).  I'm hoping I can get a reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas.  I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly, THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in Texas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging?  As much as I'd like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me, I can't help but feel for the people in Minnesota, unless they truly didn't support the team.    Opinions, please.[/INST]

   You are absolutely correct.  Braves fans are nothing but a bunch of bandwagoners.  Correct me if I am wrong, but 4 or 5 years ago you couldnt give away a ticket to see the Braves play.I  would bet my next paycheck that 80% of the so-called Braves fans living outside of Georgia at the present time can not name more than 3 players from their 1988 season. On the other hand, ask any Cubs fan living anywhere in the United States to name 3 players from any given year and 80% of them probably could.  Granted, the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park, but that does not mean they diserve the title ""America's Team""  The only reason they are considered America's team is because of Ted Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation.

FLAME ON  Reading through the posts about Kirlian (whatever spelling) photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the narrow-minded, ""I know it all"", ""I don't believe what I can't see or measure"" attitude of many people out there.  I am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to so-called ""paranormal"" stuff; but as far as I'm concerned, it is just as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis.  I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to something, ANYTHING, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame of reference. History shows that many great people, great scientists, were people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics.  Especially the USA should be grateful; after all, Columbus did not drop off the edge of the earth.  FLAME OFF, or end sermon :-)[/INST]

Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2012 - (Sec. 2) States that the provisions of this Act shall apply to: (1) a consent decree or settlement agreement in an action to compel agency action alleged to be unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed that pertains to a regulatory action that affects the rights of private parties other than the plaintiff or the rights of state, local, or tribal governments brought under judicial review provisions of the U.S. Code or under any other statute authorizing such an action; and (2) any other consent decree or settlement agreement that requires agency action that pertains to a regulatory action that affects the rights of private parties other than the plaintiff or the rights of state, local, or tribal governments. Sets forth requirements with respect to actions to be resolved by a consent decree or settlement agreement under this Act, including requiring: (1) publication in a readily accessible manner (including electronically) of the complaint, the consent decree or settlement agreement, the statutory basis for the decree or agreement and its terms, and any award of attorneys' fees or costs; (2) an opportunity for affected parties to intervene in an action prior to the entry of a consent decree or settlement agreement; (3) referral to a mediation or alternative dispute resolution program after a motion to intervene is granted; (4) an opportunity for public comment on a proposed consent decree or settlement agreement before it is filed with a court; and (5) approval by the Attorney General of any proposed consent decree or settlement agreement in cases litigated by the Department of Justice (DOJ). Requires each agency to submit an annual report to Congress on the number, identity, and content of complaints, consent decrees, and settlement agreements for that year, including the statutory basis for each decree or agreement and its terms, and any awards of attorneys fees or costs in actions resolved by decrees or agreements. (Sec. 3) Requires a court to grant de novo review to any motion filed by an agency to modify a previously-entered consent decree if the basis of such motion is that the terms of the decree are no longer fully in the public interest due to the agency's obligations to fulfill other duties or due to changed facts and circumstances.

Keeping All Students Safe Act Directs the Department of Education (ED) to establish minimum standards that: prohibit elementary and secondary school personnel from managing any student by using any mechanical or chemical restraint, physical restraint or escort that restricts breathing, or aversive behavioral intervention that compromises student health and safety; prohibit such personnel from using physical restraint or seclusion, unless such measures are required to eliminate an imminent danger of physical injury to the student or others and certain precautions are taken; require states and local educational agencies (LEAs) to ensure that a sufficient number of school personnel receive state-approved crisis intervention training and certification in first aid and certain safe and effective student management techniques; prohibit physical restraint or seclusion from being written into a student's education plan, individual safety plan, behavioral plan, or individual education program as a planned intervention; and require schools to establish procedures to notify parents in a timely manner if physical restraint or seclusion is imposed on their child. Authorizes ED to award grants to states and, through them, competitive subgrants to LEAs to: (1) establish, implement, and enforce policies and procedures to meet such standards; (2) improve their capacity to collect and analyze data related to physical restraint and seclusion; and (3) implement school-wide positive behavior supports.

Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Efficient Banking Act of 2010 or the SAFE Banking Act of 2010 - Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to prohibit a bank holding company from holding more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States. Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to require any bank holding company having a deposit concentration in violation of this Act to sell or transfer assets to unaffiliated firms to bring the company into compliance with this Act. Prescribes minimum leverage ratios (6% of average total consolidated assets) and balance sheet leverage ratios (6% of tier 1 capital for all outstanding balance sheet liabilities) for tier 1 capital maintained by a bank holding company or financial company. Authorizes the Board and other federal regulators to grant an emergency temporary exemption from such ratio requirements where necessary to prevent an imminent threat to the financial stability of the United States. Directs the Board to: (1) establish a leverage ratio and a balance sheet leverage ratio for all operating subsidiaries of bank holding companies and financial companies; and (2) require a noncompliant bank holding company or financial company to raise capital, sell, or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance sheet items to unaffiliated firms (prompt corrective action). Prohibits a bank holding company from possessing nondeposit liabilities exceeding 2% percent of the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States. Authorizes the Board to: (1) set a separate liability limit for certain bank holding companies primarily engaged in the business of insurance; and (2) exclude specified deposits from its calculation of nondeposit liabilities if necessary to ensure consistent and equitable treatment of institutions with international operations. Prohibits a financial company from possessing nondeposit liabilities exceeding 3% of the U.S. annual GDP. Requires the Board to conduct, and report to Congress on, an annual capital assessment to estimate losses, revenues, and reserve needs for bank holding companies and financial companies.

Their navy is entirely made of F-USSR vessels.  Their airforce (not including stuff captured from Kuwait which I am not as sure about), doesn't include any US equipment.  Their missiles are all non-US.  Their tanks are almost all soviet, with about 100 French tanks (older ones). The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal is a few M113s.  Those were not sold to Iraq.  Iraq captured them from other countries (like Kuwait).  Information is hard to prove.  You are claiming that the US sold information?  Prove it.   Now, how did the US build up Iraq again?

 Unlikely.  Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it is when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding the pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not propel the bullet with any significant velocity.  In fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded cartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough to take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe.  Thus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.[/INST]

Great Bay Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 This bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to postpone for five years establishing water quality standards or effluent limitations under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) if those standards or limitations reduce nitrogen discharges into the Great Bay Estuary. That estuary extends from the mouth of Portsmouth Harbor, in the vicinity of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to the head-of-tide for the eight rivers (including the tributaries of those rivers) that flow into Great Bay, Little Bay, and the Piscataqua River. During that five-year period, the EPA may not require a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) to commence construction on any upgrade of a facility for the purpose of enforcing those standards or limitations if the POTW contributes nitrogen loadings in that estuary. The EPA must study eelgrass levels and the causes of any loss of eelgrass habitat in the Great Bay Estuary, and allow public participation in the development of the study.[/INST]

Prohibits a federal agency or program and any state or local government that receives federal financial assistance under PPACA from requiring any health plan created or regulated under PPACA to discriminate against any institutional or individual health care entity based on the entity's refusal to undergo training in the performance of induced abortions, require or provide such training, or refer for such training. Creates a cause of action for any violations of the abortion provisions of PPACA. Gives federal courts jurisdiction to prevent and redress actual or threatened violations of such provisions by issuing any form of legal or equitable relief, including injunctions and orders preventing the disbursement of all or a portion of federal financial assistance until the prohibited conduct has ceased. Gives standing to institute an action to affected health care entities and the Attorney General. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to designate the Director of the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to receive and investigate complaints alleging a violation of PPACA abortion provisions. Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to ensure that no multistate qualified health plan offered in an Exchange provides coverage of abortion services.[/INST]

 As the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not batting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark.

    I think there is another formula for ERA.  I heard something about it last  year.  Im not sure what it is, but im gonna give it a stab.  It allows for a pitcher to pitch more than 9 innings at a time and not benefit, cuz it uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched...

The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given  NATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally, in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all.  And even then, they cleverly  cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded ""national exposure,"" but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it.  The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript. We'll never know if he would have kept that one.   Strangely enough, the previous day they said they were prepared to ""wait as long as it takes.""   Quite possible.  But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing  line between guilt and innocence -- only the line between murder and  negligent manslaughter.   This would be an interesting development.

     What do you accept as a fact --  the roundness of the earth (after  all, the ancient Greeks thought it was a sphere, and then Newton said  it was a spheroid, and now people say it's a geoid [?])?  yourself  (isn't your personal identity just a theoretical construct to make  sense of memories, feelings, perceptions)?

Federal Buildings Energy Savings Act of 2013 - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to direct each federal agency to implement requirements for the use of energy and water efficiency measures in federal buildings through private financing instead of appropriations, unless: (1) to do so conflicts with the primary mission of the agency or facility, or (2) if greater cost savings can be generated under a different program. Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to direct agencies to include in energy savings performance contracts appropriate termination clauses for facilities that will or may close before the end of a contract's term. Includes as an ""energy or water conservation measure"" under such Act a measure to support the use of electric vehicles or the fueling or charging infrastructure necessary for such vehicles.

Japan Currency Manipulation Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress on: (1) currency intervention by Japan with respect to the rate of exchange of the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar and other currencies since 2000; and (2) any effort by Japan to create an exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with respect to the U.S. dollar and other currencies since March 2004. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a proposal for a comprehensive joint U.S.-European Union plan to address the exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with respect to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Directs the Secretary to: (1) initiate consultations with Japan to decrease Japan's foreign currency reserve holdings to permit effective balance of payments adjustments and to eliminate its unfair competitive advantage in international trade; and (2) take appropriate action to dissuade, prevent, or object to currency intervention by Japan. Directs the United States to call for the convening of a special meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reach a multilateral agreement regarding: (1) the exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with respect to the U.S. dollar and other currencies; (2) the destabilizing effects of the exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen; and (3) Japan's excessive foreign currency reserve holdings.

 Even I noticed that Gant's demeanor was not one of a batter attempting to regain his concentration.  Gant was stalking off. I wonder if Gant said something to the ump?   Actually, there was a small hand wave by Gant...as if to say 'Don't bother me'. Gant may have said something here, too.   Cox was already halfway to the ump when the strike was called.   My impression was that Gant was not 'stepping out.'  He was making a protest about the lack of an appeal to first.  As has been pointed out earlier, there is no appeal to first on a strike. I can understand Gant feeling a little pressure in a two-out, RISP, 1 - 0 game, ninth inning.  He let it get to him.  The ump also overreacted.  Gant was stalking off, but I doubt he would have been gone long.  Hirschbeck should have let him have a moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat. IMHO, umpires should be more flexible than what Hirschbeck showed.  Gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely he would not get a hit.[/INST]

[This is SWF in another indirect post via Dan].  predicitions if you have some many types of happen again may predict reaction  There are several problems here. First, you are discussing only experimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make prediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be the result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of the lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the observations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science - it is *not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted sense.  Secondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just the requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results. The observation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observer may look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also, there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond to the current one.  New fossils are found often enough[/INST]

 Sadly understandable...   Yes.  To be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.   Again, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there was only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didn't say all that many things, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have arisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of ""personal interpretation"".   This is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a system of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least not without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to the point of ""testing hypotheses"" against[/INST]

YAHOOOOOOOOO!  The Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec City to play game 5.  BTW, final score was Habs 3-Nords 2.  The score might be a bit misleading.  The Habs dominated the game from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on.  The score should have been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall (bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winning goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd.  Roy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another) and the defense was there to clear any rebounds.  This just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT. YAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

The best reason to abolishing the ATF is that they don't have enough to do.  If the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to the FBI (firearms) and IRS (tobacco and alcohol).  Both of these organizations have enough to do.  The FBI is probably not going to try to get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken gun.

  Absolute nonsense.  The decision that was made was Pocklington's.  He chose  20 mill over Gretzky.  If Gretzky wasn't upset about not being able to win a cup in LA then I submit that he wasn't worth the 20 mill.   How do you know what he thinks (or thought)?  The only ""thought"" that I can see that you have revealed is your own.  You don't like Gretzky. Big deal.   The real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty.

  Sorry Charles...According to the National Safety Council, ACCIDENT FACTS,1991 ""In 1990, gun accidents were the fifth-leading cause of accidental death for children ages 14 and under.""

So this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease, chronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes.  Oh, okay Charles, that makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES of death.

How is it that placebos are legal?  It would seem to me that if, as a patient, you purchase a drug you've been prescribed and it's just sugar (or whatever), there's a few legal complications that arise:   1.  If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren't given accepted treatment for it, it seems like intentional medical malpractice.   2. A placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?)   3. Getting what you pay for.  (Deceptive ""bait and switch"" to an extreme...).

 That would be Clint Malarchuck.  It was speculated at the time, that the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the ambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  Ditto, if he were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on  standby.  If you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood there was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.    Amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the NHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway, and didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and I think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward. He did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after that, and then I believe he retired.  Anyone else?  --  [/INST]

  That is not an ""atheism mythology"" in any sense of the word. ""Religious paradoy"" would be significantly more appropriate.   The 2nd part is rendered null and void by the simple fact that I do know several ""strong"" atheists. I am sure that others do. I myself am ""strong"" in the sense that I find the standard concept of God without any meaning. Any attempt to bring meaning either results in the destruction of  the viability of language, or in internal self contradiction.    The concept of strong atheism is not just a whimsical fantasy.

  Though David Sternlight pushes the envelope of credibility by claiming that talk.politics.guns is not the place to discuss guns, or the meaning of the Second Amendment, it seems he would rather post to millions of people out  of relative ignorance of the subject than to follow the currently active  threads discussing EXACTLY this topic which at least explore the fallacies  of his erroneous claim, and at most explode them.  Basic fact #1, Mr. Sternlight:  The RIGHT described is a ""right of the people to keep and bear arms;"" not a ""right of the people to form a militia,"" a ""right of a militia to keep and bear arms,"" or a ""right of well-regulated people to keep and bear arms.""

     Very narrow.  Very, very narrow.  If you'll recall, I was the nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia weapons in certain situations.  How can you possibly define what is a weapon and what isn't is only the start of this.     And you've just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered.  Reactors blow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See what a can of worms this is?  Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just north of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the PRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor itself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is flawed in a few respects already.    Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill[/INST]

National Forest Emergency Response Act - Declares that the fire hazard and human endangerment in national forests to be designated by the Secretary of Agriculture constitute emergency circumstances. Directs the Secretary to designate (for up to 10 years) at least one national forest in each state that is experiencing conditions that constitute emergency circumstances due to pine beetle infestation, drought, disease, or storm damage and the resulting imminent risk of devastating wildfire that poses significant threat to the economic stability of surrounding areas and the health, safety, and well-being of residents, firefighters, and visitors. Makes provisions of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act regarding hazardous fuel reduction on federal land (including environmental analysis requirements, the special administrative review process, and the judicial review process) applicable to all Forest Service projects and activities implementing the land and resource management plan developed for the designated national forests during the term of the emergency circumstances, subject to specified modifications by the Secretary. Requires a project conducted in a designated national forest under this Act that comprises less than 10,000 acres (with exceptions, including components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, any federal land on which the removal of vegetation is restricted or prohibited by Act of Congress or presidential proclamation, or a congressionally designated wilderness study area) to be considered an action categorically excluded from the requirements for an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. Prohibits a U.S. court from issuing any restraining order, preliminary injunction, or injunction pending appeal regarding any decision to engage in remedial action or to prepare, advertise, offer, award, or operate a timber sale in a designated forest. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement or contract with a state forester to provide forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration and protection services on national forest system land in that state.[/INST]

 It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, the April 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average and a .413 OBP. That's on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks. The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he's has a long history of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for drawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB's I'd be convinced that there was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I'd not only be amazed but I'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in the history of the game. But what do 45 AB's prove?

 I see that I misphrased my question.  I should have asked WHICH full-autos Kratz can accurately distinguish from semi-auto look-alikes.  I should have also included some semi-auto only guns in my list to see if he'd ask how to distinguish them from their non-existent full-auto ""relatives"".  Let's do the former now.  Kratz has claimed that he can visually distinguish full-autos from semi-autos.  For which full-autos is he making that claim?  How does he do it?  Let's get specific, and as exhaustive as possible.   Maybe?  Why is Kratz asking about what he told us that he knows?  Is Kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from a two position switch via TV inspection?  (Does he even get to see the switch in the typical police display of guns?)  Note that one might well be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection even though it won't be seen on TV.  And to think that Kratz was telling us that seeing it on TV was just as accurate as being there....   Why all the questions?  Kratz[/INST]

Sugar Reform Act of 2015 This bill revises the Department of Agriculture (USDA) sugar program to decrease price support levels and make other modifications. The bill amends the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 to decrease the rate for price support loans to processors of domestically grown sugarcane and sugar beets. The loan rate is the price level at which processors can take out loans. The bill amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to require USDA to set the marketing allotments at a level appropriate to maintain adequate domestic supplies at reasonable prices. The allotments limit the amount of sugar that each processor may sell. The allotments may be suspended or modified based on: (1) the interests of consumers, workers, businesses, and agricultural producers; and (2) the relative competitiveness of domestically produced and imported foods containing sugar. In setting import quotas necessary to comply with trade agreements, USDA must: set the quotas at no less than the minimum level necessary for compliance, adjust the quotas to provide adequate domestic supplies at reasonable prices, establish and adjust quotas so that the ratio of sugar stocks to total sugar use at the end of the year will be approximately 15.5% or the target necessary to prevent unreasonably high prices or forfeitures, and permit the temporary transfer of quotas between countries. The bill amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to repeal the Feedstock Flexibility Program for Bioenergy Producers, which requires USDA to purchase sugar from domestic processors and sell it to bioenergy producers for biofuel production.[/INST]

I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the greater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart rate and PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate is associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its size. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the effects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, she asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when exercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners.   So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart patients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficial aspects to athlete's heart? Is it all good?[/INST]

The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries. I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.  ____________________________________________________________________________ [Reprinted w/o permission]   ""There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries""  By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services        On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings  is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.      It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called  Families USA.       The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe  that doctors make too much money.      The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for  physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be  OK.      How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.      Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based[/INST]

Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2013 - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to suspend the registration of imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, dinotafuran, and any other members of the nitro group of neonicotinoid insecticides to the extent such insecticide is registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) for use in seed treatment, soil application, or foliar treatment on bee attractive plants, trees, and cereals until the Administrator has made a determination that such insecticide will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on pollinators. Requires such a determination to be based on: (1) an evaluation of the published and peer-reviewed scientific evidence on whether the use or uses of such neonicotinoids cause unreasonable adverse effects on pollinators, including native bees, honeybees, birds, bats, and other species of beneficial insects; and (2) a completed field study that meets the criteria required by the Administrator and evaluates residues, including residue build-up after repeated annual application, chronic low-dose exposure, and cumulative effects of multiple chemical exposures. Prohibits the Administrator from issuing any new registrations of the pesticides listed in this Act for any seed treatment, soil application, and foliar treatment on bee attractive plants, trees, and cereals under FIFRA until the Administrator has made such determination with respect to such insecticide. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Administrator, to: (1) regularly monitor the health and population status of native bees, (2) identify the scope and likely causes of unusual native bee mortality, and (3) submit to Congress and make public an annual report on such health and population status.[/INST]

This response originally fell into a bit bucket.  I'm reposting it just so Bill doesn't think I'm ignoring him.   Bill,  I'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to this.  Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms are then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack of an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and don't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.   An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according to a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in an absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit, as in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad. My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when[/INST]

[...]  The President is not competent to plan or judge the planning of such a raid, nor does he need to be.  His job is to set basic policies and manage the people under him.  If Clinton instructed Reno to preserve lives, and if she confirmed that the plan for the raid was a safe as could be, then he did his job.  The President should not involve himself in the minor details of these kinds of operations.  This sort of micromanagement only leads to disaster, as was demonstrated so well in Vietnam.  But the raid went bad:  Over 80 civilians have been killed in a controntation with U.S. authorities.  NOW Clinton enters the picture in a big way.  Will Clinton start an investigation?

Chesapeake Clean Water and Ecosystem Restoration Act - (Sec. 3) Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Program. Renames such program as the Chesapeake Basin Program. Revises such Program by: (1) revising and expanding definitions; (2) requiring the Chesapeake Executive Council to meet at least once each year; (3) authorizing the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide technical assistance and assistance grants to soil conservation districts, basin commissions, and the project manager of the Chesapeake nutrient trading guarantee program established by this Act in addition to other entities eligible for such assistance; and (4) expanding the implementation and monitoring grant programs. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants for establishing and supporting centers of excellence for water quality and agriculture practices to: (1) develop new technologies and innovative policies and practices for agricultural producers to reduce nitrogen, phosphorous, and sediment pollution; (2) quantify the expected load reductions of those pollutants to be achieved in the Chesapeake Basin through the implementation of current and newly developed technologies, policies, and practices; and (3) provide to the Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture recommendations for the widespread deployment of those technologies, policies, and practices among agricultural producers and their application in Chesapeake Basin computer models. Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish a five-year Chesapeake nutrient trading guarantee pilot program to support the interstate trading program established by this Act; and (2) designate a project manager to carry out such pilot program, provide guarantees to purchasers of nutrient credits under the interstate trading program, and ensure public transparency for nutrient trading activities through a publicly available trading registry. Establishes in the Treasury the Chesapeake Nutrient Trading Guarantee Fund to be administered by the Administrator for such pilot program. Requires the Administrator to ensure that at least 10% of funds for implementation grants be made available to Delaware, New York, and West Virginia and that at least 20% of such funds be made available to Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia to provide technical assistance to agricultural producers and foresters. Requires federal agencies that own or operate facilities within the Chesapeake Basin to participate in regional and subwatershed planning and restoration programs. Requires the head of each federal agency that owns or occupies real property in the Basin to ensure that the property, and actions taken by the agency with respect to the property, comply with: (1) the Chesapeake Bay Agreement; (2) the Federal Agencies Chesapeake Ecosystem Unified Plan; (3) the Chesapeake Basin action plan; and (4) any subsequent agreements and plans. Requires the Administrator, by January 1, 2012, to coordinate with the head of each federal agency that owns or operates a facility within the Chesapeake Basin to develop plans to maximize forest cover at the facility through the preservation of existing forest cover or the development of a reforestation plan.

Renewable Electricity Promotion Act of 2010 - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to establish a standard that requires electric utilities to obtain an increasing percentage of their base quantity of electricity that they sell to consumers from renewable energy or energy efficiency (3% in 2012-2013, 6% in 2014-2016, 9% in 2017-2018, 12% in 2019-2020, and 15% in 2021-2039). Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to establish a renewable energy credit trading program and an energy efficiency credit trading program, under which utilities will submit credits to comply with such standard. Provides for the issuance, duration, transfer, trading, tracking, and reporting of credits. Sets forth civil penalties for utilities that fail to meet such requirements. Allows the Secretary to delegate to: (1) a market-making entity the administration of a national renewable energy credit market and a national energy efficiency credit market to create a transparent national market for the sale or trade of such credits, and (2) regional entities the tracking of dispatch of renewable energy generation;. Authorizes: (1) a state public utility commission or electric utility to request a variance from such renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements, and (2) a utility to meet such requirements by submitting alternative compliance payments. Allows: (1) a governor to expend amounts in a state renewable energy escrow account solely for increasing the quantity of electric energy produced from a renewable energy source in the state, promoting deployment and use of electric drive vehicles in the state, and offsetting the costs of carrying out this Act paid by consumers in the state through direct grants to electric consumers or energy efficiency investments; and (2) states to adopt or enforce laws concerning renewable energy or energy efficiency or the regulation of electric utilities. Exempts from renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements an electric utility that sold less than 4 million megawatt hours of electric energy to electric consumers during the preceding year or that is located in Hawaii. Requires the Secretary, when petitioned by the governor of a state or the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the case of TVA's power service area, to allow up to 26.67% of the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements associated with the sales of electricity of a utility to be met by submitting federal energy efficiency credits. Requires: (1) the Secretary to promulgate regulations regarding the measurement and verification of electricity savings; and (2) the increment of electricity output of a new combined heat and power system that is attributable to the higher efficiency of the combined system to be considered electricity savings. Requires the Secretary to make loans available to electric utilities to: (1) construct a renewable energy generation facility; and (2) install an energy efficiency or electricity demand reduction technology.

Any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there ?  The doctor thinks a friend might have this. The question is, doesn't the tick have to bite you ?

Can you get the fever without it biting you ?  Do they sometimes bite you and then let go so you don't realize you were bitten ?  I know they will let go once they've had their fill, but you certainly would notice this (arggh).

My last response in this thread fell into a bit-bucket and vanished (though appearing locally).  I'll repost it, since I always feel slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a conversational thread, I don't want Rob to think I'm doing so.  Since this is now dated, however, don't feel compelled to respond...   I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have been referring to; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition like this is what happens when a schism occurs, and over time certain large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor exactly a ""face value"" interpretation...   While the context of the time is important, value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some base standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.).  This is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people, for instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look rather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in what way is it better to worship a single god[/INST]

  Take a look at the standings. It's REAL easy to get so focussed on  minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place. If it's working, you don't SCREW IT UP by changing things, just because you think it ought to be different.  Some folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams win. When the Giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange the batting order. Until then, I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong, for the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS.   In the majors? I don't follow AL, so I won't comment on ""Majors"". In the NL, if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it'd be Clark, and I'd hit him third.

Lincoln Legacy Infrastructure Development Act - Prohibits the Secretary from imposing a federal surcharge on a state that has allowed the placement of blind vending facilities in rest and recreation areas, and in safety rest areas, located on Interstate System (IS) rights-of-way. Revises state high occupancy vehicle (HOV) facility requirements to increase from a minimum of two to a minimum of three the number of occupants per vehicle for use of an HOV facility in cases of congestion meeting certain criteria. Amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 to remove limits on the number of state or local governments or public authorities with which the Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements to establish value pricing pilot programs (in effect, allowing extension of the programs to all such authorities). Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) to increase from 3 to 10 the number of IS highways, bridges, or tunnels where a state may collect tolls for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of IS highway corridors. Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to eliminate restrictions on: (1) the number of projects under the express lanes demonstration program (currently 15), and (2) the number of IS facilities on which the Secretary may collect IS construction tolls (currently 3). Eliminates the nonsubordination of secured loans and lines of credit used to finance surface transportation project costs to the claims of any holder of project obligations in the event of the obligor's bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation. (Thus allows subordination of secured loans and lines of credit to such claims.) Makes eligible for railroad rehabilitation and improvement direct loans and loan guarantees: (1) projects and activities that benefit high-speed rail, and (2) development phase activities. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to establish a six-year public-private partnership experimental program to encourage recipients of certain federal assistance to carry out tests and experimentation in the public transportation project development process designed to: (1) attract private investment in such projects (including high occupancy/toll [HOT] lane facilities); and (2) increase project management flexibility and innovation, improve efficiency, allow for timely project implementation, and create new revenue streams. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to remove the cap on the aggregate allowable amount of tax-exempt bonds to finance qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities. Revises a specified formula in order to reduce annual adjustments to pay schedules for federal employees for FY2013-FY2021.[/INST]

  But this is all gun control laws end up doing.  Politicians can never manage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally, so all their laws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally.  Karen McNutt, a local attorney, states that there are about two MILLION licensed gun owners in Massachusetts.  In the past year, the number of licensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like SIX. Yet, there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year.  Does passing laws that will further restricting only those people ALREADY obeying laws pay any dividents?   So far, I've seen them treated with the least respect by legislators.   See, this is what I call the ""argument from religion:"" ""I believe.""  Don't believe -- it's not NECESSARY to take this on faith.  Go look at the history of countries that passed gun restrictions.  Pay particular attention to whether or not violent crime was HIGHER before the restrictions and LOWER after.  (Don't look at ""violent gun crimes,"" that's begging the question.)

  [stuff about Ron Gant incident deleted]    I agree that Hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do and also that Gant should have listened to him.  However, what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games.  You are the first person  ( non-mediot ) I have seen endorse this policy.  I have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the ESPN crowd ( and other announcers ) bitching about it.  I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and shouting ""Hurry up!""  If I cough up big bucks for a  ticket, I don't mind a game that last more than 2:10.  I really don't understand it.     Games are longer now for several reasons:  more pitching changes, more basestealing ( and throws to first ), etc...I think a very small factor is the increased time it takes Jose Canseco/ Deion Sanders/ [insert fancy showboat ballplayer here] to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the batter's box.

Oh, yea, and Chris Bosio pitched a NO-HITTER.  One over the minimum, two bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches.  I listened to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a real treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone is better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me).  But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have  been a different story :-)  Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in Major League baseball ....

Whether one believes that these vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical research is a seperate argument.

 So, that is the reason why the Toronto Blue Jays *should* keep Alfredo Griffin, just because it ""worked""?  A team winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is right. A team not winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is wrong, or otherwise (to borrow the Sharks' situation) you would say that George Kingston should be fired.   By then, it's too late.  The problem with ""not fixing something while it's working"" is that by then, there may not be anything left to fix.

Bankruptcy Equity Act of 2012 - Amends federal bankruptcy law governing a Chapter 13 debtor (adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income) to exclude from the computation of debts the secured or unsecured portions of: (1) debts secured by the debtor's principal residence if the current value of that residence is less than the secured debt limit, or (2) debts secured or formerly secured by real property that was the debtor's principal residence that was sold in foreclosure or that the debtor surrendered to the creditor if the current value of such real property is less than the secured debt limit. Declares the credit counseling requirement inapplicable to a Chapter 13 debtor who certifies that he or she has received notice that the holder of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence may commence a foreclosure on it. Permits a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan to modify the rights of claim holders with respect to a claim for a loan originated before the effective date of this Act and secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence that is the subject of a foreclosure notice. Authorizes reduction of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence, but only in specified circumstances, particularly if the debtor sells the residence. Permits a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan to deny debtor liability for certain fees and charges incurred while the bankruptcy case is pending and arising from a debt secured by the debtor's principal residence, unless the claim holder observes specified requirements. Adds to conditions for court confirmation of a plan in bankruptcy that: (1) the holder of a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence retain the lien securing the claim until the later of the payment of the allowed secured claim or the discharge of a debtor from all debts, and (2) the plan modifies the claim in good faith. Excludes from the final discharge of a debtor from all debts any unpaid portion of such a claim as reduced. Expands federal procedures governing default on veterans' housing loans. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in the event of a modification in bankruptcy, to pay the holder of the obligation the unpaid balance due as of the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition, plus accrued interest, but only upon assignment, transfer, and delivery of all rights, interest, claims, evidence, and records regarding the loan. Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to: (1) pay Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance benefits for a mortgage modified under federal bankruptcy law, and (2) implement a program solely to encourage loan modifications for eligible delinquent mortgages through the payment of insurance benefits and assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary and the subsequent modification of the terms of the mortgage according to a loan modification approved by the mortgagee. Amends the Housing Act of 1949, with respect to guaranteed rural housing loans under the Doug Bereuter Section 502 Single Family Housing Loan Guarantee Program, to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) pay guaranteed portion of any losses incurred by the holder of a note or the loan servicer resulting from a modification in a bankruptcy proceeding, and (2) use the Rural Housing Insurance Fund to pay for losses incurred by holders or servicers in the event of a modification pursuant to a bankruptcy proceeding.[/INST]

[reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)]       If the Good is undefined (undefinable?) but you require of everyone that they know innately what is right, you are back to subjectivism.     Ditto here.  An evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the part of the person making it.     Pretty perceptive, that Prof. Flew.       Please explain how this helps.  I don't see your argument.       This makes no sense either.  Flew is arguing that this is where the objectivist winds up, not the subjectivist.  Furthermore, the nihilists believed in nothing *except* science, materialism, revolution, and the People.       And also not the position of the subjectivist, as has been pointed out to you already by others.  Ditch the strawman, already, and see my reply to Mike Cobb's root message in the thread Societal Basis for Morality.[/INST]

 And you shouldn't, as the matches kill more kids.  So why are you bleating about guns?   It may be tired, but it is true.   No, that's not right either.  People who have both easy access and the desire to kill, kill people.  Considering that people who have the desire to kill turn that into easy access ....  (Haven't you folks learned anything from either Prohibition or the war on drugs?)  If you don't affect the desire, you're wasting your time, not to mention the other costs incurred.   Good for them.  I note that the TM folks make the same argument.  If you'll pay their expesnses ($21 million for a reasonable size city), they promise to meditate away all crime, disease, etc.  At least they're not promising to jail me if I don't go along with their little plan - they're going to just sit in a room and fly, leaving me alone.

   From psc@sei.cmu.edu (Peter Capell) on rec.martial-arts...    >I'm sure such weapons have been developed.  Our society does not,    >however, condone their possession or use.    Actually, Joe, I wrote the above.  Peter was responding to my article.  I'm actually rather confused by your post.  I suppose I didn't make myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the opposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose ""the authorities"" might have been a better term than ""society"".  Carry and use a firearm in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect, at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do. And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.     In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or    so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-    abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.

I am finding the volume of stuff on rec.sport.baseball overwhelming -- ca. 200 posts/day.  An effect of this is that a backlog builds up, and many posts get dumped from my system.  I could probably fix that--but don't have the time to read them all in any event.  My guess is that mine is a common problem.  I have some ideas that would help:  1.  Each person generally post no more than one article/day. 2.  Limit the extent to which previous posts are reproduced     in posts. 3.  Don't post mindless `woofs,' or `anti-woofs,' e.g. ""The     Jays are best!""  or  ""The Jays suck."" 4.  Don't respond to mindless posts, e.g.  ""Jack Morris is     a better pitcher than Frank Viola because he's won a      World Series.""
