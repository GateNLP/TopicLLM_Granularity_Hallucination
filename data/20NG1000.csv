0," For the past week or so I've been trying to install a QIC-36 tape drive and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 EISA system with no luck. I end up getting an error (miscompare) during the streaming read part of the test. I am pretty certain that the port setting, irq & dma are set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind, retension, write and erase, I also booted the system clean and still the same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. It has been suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down. My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting option that I have seen on other systems so I cant do this. Am I going to have to accept that this set up won't work? or can anyone suggest a work around? I will be glad to hear your advice/suggestions.

That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people do, and in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became more painful and I had the repair operation.  This year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to be another inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday for another fun 8-) operation.  I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38 years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling apart like this.

To keep this as brief as possible, let me state my  observation as a declarative statement, and then whoever  wants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think  I've observed is that the phrase ""the Ten Commandments"",  as used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but  rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex.  20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase ""the Ten  Commandments"" should more accurately be translated ""the  Ten Discourses"", of which the passage we call the ""Ten  Commandments"" is really only the first.  I'm not completely convinced that the above is true, but  for purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I  was sure.  Arguments supporting the above idea:  1)  There aren't really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.

Similarly, SOME Serbs are ""doing"" to Muslims now. This is a group of serial-killers, rapists, and thieves who have control of the vast Yugoslav army arsenal.

If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a  more normal lithium battery.

Under Serbian-led regime between the two world wars, many Croats were also killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6, 1929). Some Croats formed a resistance movement ""Ustashas"" (Insurgents) and were forced into exile, to fascist Italy, which sheltered them.  In exile, they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in Croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership of Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world war, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in  to run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats (""flowers of Croatian people"").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina therefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they joined Tito's Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at  less than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.  After WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended from Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in",17,talk.politics.mideast,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480

It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered by moisture or damp air, which would short out the terminals.  The same thing happens to my car (Citroen 2CV) -- damp gets under the bonnet (US: ""hood"") and shorts the spark-plugs to earth so it won't start.  The solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with WD-40 (moisture repellant).  If damp *is* the problem, then storing the  battery off the ground may help.

969,"[ . . .]  I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of ""right"" and ""wrong"" (or ""correct/incorrect"" or ""true/false"") belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).  Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively. One can certainly ask if a percept is ""right"" (correct, true, veridical) or ""wrong"" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives.  Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.

Jobs is very much out of line with the rest of the OT books, and there's a chance that someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures.   This operates the other way around as well. You have to understand the mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical relativist. If you don't understand the underlying concepts, it is  pretty hard to continue with a dialogue.

Diesel particulates are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emit signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidence is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.  And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels is awful and it can even burn the eyes.

""Essence"" in the Platonic sense does not have any referent as far as I can tell - it is just an imaginary concept invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in other ways.  So, to attribute an 'essence' to God is to attribute to him something that does not exist!!  Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave the unity of God in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence', thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address.  Thus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must be secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one.  --  sarima@teradata.com   (formerly tdatirv!sarima)   or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com",15,soc.religion.christian,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480

Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course, this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.

890,"  Point 1:  I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole ""yeast issue"" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized ""jargon"", necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully cognizant of since I, too, speak ""jargonese"" when with my peers).  For the situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word, and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of ""systemic"". It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really ""beat up"" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they otherwise don't see much of in their practice",13,sci.med,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480

The part I quote above seems to me to indicate disapproval of capital punishment - it is to be used only when other means are not sufficient; I would say this is a stronger restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when justifiable. I would certainly say there are cases where a crime justifies death (perhaps this is the Old Testament interpretation), but my reverence for life would say that I would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty (a New Testament interpretation?). It is a matter for debate whether the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that non-violent provisions do not.

831," I can't answer all our questions in detail, but I can take a stab at them.  The form the operations that compute R1, R2, and R3 is, of course, the famous ``triple encryption'' suggested for use with DES.  It's much stronger than a single encryption, and has an effective key length of 160 bits.  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first standardized, a simple double encryption would not have the same strength.  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less the beginning to encrypt other keys.  It's recommended for anything of very high value.  And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit that description.  Why n_1, n_2, and n_3?  Well, you need different plaintext values.  I have no idea if they'll be disclosed or not.  At a guess, they're constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible. A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change -- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit patterns, and there might, conceivably, be a weakness.

For every twenty or so newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there would appear one Muslim voice.

(As an aside, it's interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up, some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these  groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of  hate towards these groups.

You are correct that the frequency content is not altered (more specifically, the baseband spectrum is preserved, and so is every Nth image spectrum. The other (N-1) in N image spectra are removed, where N is the oversampling rate)   Ideally the filter has a gain of 1 from 0Hz to 22050Hz, and a gain of 0 from 22050 to the new Nyquist frequency. In practice a finite transition band is required, and there is also a certain amount of pass-band ripple and stop-band leakage.

Briefly, the cops get a wiretap warrant, and record the call.  They then notice the encryption and the disclosure header.  It, along with a copy of their warrant, is sent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key.  The F-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and the encrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents.  They, in turn, use U1 and U2 to recover K, and send that to the local police.  Note how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever.  Neither the cops nor the FBI ever see U, so they can't read other traffic.  Every request must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents.  The cops and the FBI together can't cheat, since they don't have U.  (I regard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the system.",11,sci.crypt,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480

182," Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net with his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.  The way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth, and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above replacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6; 1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks substantially right.  In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of .180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is ""Billy Ripken"". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I",9,rec.sport.baseball,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480

I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due to thermal cycle stresses...)

205,"  The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform real-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates sustainable by today's modems.  This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device, compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encrypts it with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio back to the audio device.  The compressed, encrypted audio stream is 13 kbits/s (!).  My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days, certainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity (audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I ran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember, though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can certainly be improved.

255,"The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in Hearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new' technology for hearing aids.  The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy' situations.  The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable), apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies, while the important consonant information (unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness'.

256,"genealogical  old   Well, since my wife is (in your gentle term) a ""bastard"", I can probably speak with a bit of authority on this. Any ""stigma"" associated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests solely upon the parents--they've committed a sexual transgression for which they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations on him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the parents' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS theology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the subsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of Mormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have failed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this passage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).  Also note that there is no ""big genealogical book in Salt Lake City"". The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains containing (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening, baptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world.

Too much can block the external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some  hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your own, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up) and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and   firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl  under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).

It's from    P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  where G' is the complement of G  and by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).  In a sense, HG is necessarily more ""complicated"" than H for any H and G, so I may be splitting hairs, but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG) holds, with equality if and only if P(HG') = 0.   Well, ""P(x | A) = P(x | B)"" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):",0,alt.atheism,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480

Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.

One application is soldering to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches. If you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver off of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated solution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be disolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.",12,sci.electronics,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480

106,"  I include the key verse (D&C 68:25) because others may not have the reference.  ""And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.""  What is ""the sin"" of the parents?    Ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle. However, it assumes that fathers and sons have  equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment.  Parents are responsible to teach their children the Gospel and other life skills.  Should they fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their  children, the parent would be held responsible -- not for their children's sins, but for not teaching them properly.  Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position  of authority in either the family or the church He expects that person to teach those in his charge.  In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care",15,soc.religion.christian,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480
107," Be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the mirror.  It will depress the foam liner in the helmet.  That is not the kind of foam that bounces back, like foam rubber.  Its purpose in life is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin. If your mirror compresses it, there is that much less energy absorbing capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash.  I found the right handlebar to be a good spot, if on the sidestand. Hang with the chinbar facing up, balanced across the grip and brake lever such that the weight of the helmet doesn't compress any of the chinbar foam.  This is more challanging with an open face helmet. ",8,rec.motorcycles,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480

118," The problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to the power surge at start up.  It is due to thermal fatigue.  You turn on your computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it cools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles of this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal cycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it off (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the phosphor).

131," Not necessarily. If the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due to the heat, a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate. In fire aftermaths, bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of meat with little effort. Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning up such scenes.   As such, if the body had been suitably cooked, a bullet comming from a magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the time of death, or much later, unless you were trained to look for the evidence.

But Deborah says (Judges 5:24):   > Blessed among women shall be Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite,  > Blessed above all women in the tents.  It can doubtless be taken that Jael's slaying of Sisera was a type of Mary's victory over sin. But even if we take Deborah's words as applying prophetically or symbolically to Mary, they must still be applicable literally to Jael.  We may well take them to mean that God used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His people, and that she has this in common with Mary.

83,"[heats of formation deleted]  The major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution. PbSO4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  Also, H2SO4 is in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of PbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.   As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing). (More about this later.)  What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this: (we're talking lead-acid batteries of course) The battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things happen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead            and lead oxide plates are dissolved).         -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution            becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).

84,"[some deletions]  Well, we agree on the last part.:-)  One of the basic things you need to  have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  A  player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year. A player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated better.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year.  Put in  some simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of  the basic problems with something like ""clutch"" batting average - overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero.

There were also other books being written at about this time and later by Greek-speaking, or ""Hellenistic"", Jews.  These books are those which are reckoned by many denominations as ""Apocrypha"".  Before the closing of the Writings, the third part of what is today called the canon, all of the books were in use by Jews of the day.  However, there were those who reckoned (based on Zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased. This faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day.  They also maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine teachings from God.  By the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess.

However, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to Chicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund panicks sooner in November.

However, there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home. As a former bishop of mine said, ""Children are  always worthy before God.""

523," Well, it's not that simple -- you're in Earth's magnetic field, and you don't generate electricity -- but it can be done.   The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say ""propel"" rather than ""power"", the answer is ""sort of"".)  Yes, you can use interaction with the Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential applications for this.  However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations, however.  What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays, and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.

Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment is generally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the case with your wife. Thyroxin orally does ""shut down the thyroid"" through a feedback loop involving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary ""thinks"" that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to tell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable!

When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal. I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear.

Essentially what I am trying to decide is the best way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use by the smart data I/O.   Which DMA or microcontroller chip would be best to use?  Fast, cheap, and easy to obtain would be nice, but I won't limit my choices to only those that fit those characteristics.  Even an 8086/8088 (under $5) would do what I want, but I am sure there is a better alternative -- like a microcontroller with onchip (E)EPROM.

One day, the Japanese started showing up with discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the products.  This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field  offices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computer systems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data out double-block-encrypted with DES.   Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to ""knock it off"". The president gave in, since his company did a considerable business with the federal government.

However, there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network. To be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large part of the problem.  In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like Galileo or Cassini.   It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion.

As a Leaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I was very disappointed.  You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least in his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and for that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues).
