" Minor point:  Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but not with the Jets in mind as the tennant.  The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea. When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using the new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing with the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.   I'm under the impression that when Murph says it, he means it!  As a regular goer to Shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and renovated the place.

However, a fielder who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; this means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.  Has anyone seen these players' positioning?

However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I can get this for $230 from any Ford service center.

As a result, when you stop for a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to ""reset"" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when put in drive.    My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).

"[some deletions]  Well, we agree on the last part.:-)  One of the basic things you need to  have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  A  player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year. A player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated better.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year.  Put in  some simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of  the basic problems with something like ""clutch"" batting average - overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero.

Anyone remember this?  Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was inevitable.  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first?  Another pair of suggestions: 1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay ""safe""    no matter what the pitcher does.  2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)    without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base    as if walked.  The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows the runner to ""challenge"" pitcher to throw over to the base.

Edmonton has been fairly - supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market - team, they had many sellouts in the 80s.

However he has almost nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name.

To the best of my knowledge, the only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section of the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.  2.)

Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.

" Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong  as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger.  Hurt found that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn't used their brakes at all prior to impact.    I think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in  a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you ever use, and to practice it constantly, even when you have no need to do any turning.  If you follow me down a long straight, and I seem to be  wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need, it's because I'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in my path.  All of this practice may indeed be futile, but if I have even milliseconds to react, the most *familiar* tactic available (and hopefully  the most automatic) will be countersteering.  The same logic applies to braking with the front brake, of course.",8,rec.motorcycles,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480,yes

" On the subject of the upcoming new Mustang:    The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my ""car circle"" is that the  suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current Cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior. After the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided  independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in  a volume car.    The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Ford is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority.   Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new Camaro/Firebird, IMO.

However, there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain and discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another player. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of respect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he slashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a Leaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I was very disappointed.  You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least in his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and for that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues).

All Kjell could do, at 8'7"" and 355 pounds, was laugh!  And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a little out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat.  I've always supported the argument ""he does his job by being irritating,"" but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course, Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either. It seems that he was following the ""The only way to beat the Penguins is to injure them"" philosophy.

Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Juan Gonzalez would not have made.""  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra  Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.

" Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net with his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.  The way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth, and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above replacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6; 1B, 16.9.

"    But it is subject to all kinds of bias, and is almost completely useless for first basemen.  From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and which were made on his own plays; likewise, you can't tell whether a double play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3.  Fielding Runs thus gives a first baseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and errors.    It thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently.  It also hurts first baseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few left-handed batters.   This is better; of course, it still isn't all of a first baseman's defense.   Defensive Average, which uses larger (and probably better) zones, has Mattingly tied for second in the league.   While 233 batting runs is good, it is mostly in the past; the runs he produced in 1986 don't say much about his value in 1993.   ",9,rec.sport.baseball,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480,yes

A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air    intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is    low.  No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.  Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output  and mileage are enhanced by these measures.

It has worked fine for me for two years now, and *seems* (to me, anyway) that it is very secure.  It doesn't have the weaknesses that the U-locks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick supposedly, is much easier to store in my tankbag than a U-lock, and more versatile.

Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned run, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA is 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.   ERA = (ER/IP) * 9  An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error.

The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper, and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar.

" Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most  instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more  performance.

Altitude, barometric pressure... Anyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound, which is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks.

OK (but I'm right!)  :^)   If that's the ""official line"" taught in those rider education classes you were refering to, that also don't teach countersteering, I have to question the quality of the classes.  The ""official line"" in MSF curricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift.  The ""official line"" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0.   Not necessarily true.  ""Chirping"" the tire indicates impending lockup (on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking.

There will be such hitters in any league, just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.  And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year, probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past.

" IMHO this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all  of baseball.  My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot  pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least  appear in the on-deck circle.  Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot  excede three runs.  I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in  determining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the  ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in  the next half inning and earn the win.  Has this pitcher earned a win, no  way.  I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his  teammates rally to tie the score.
