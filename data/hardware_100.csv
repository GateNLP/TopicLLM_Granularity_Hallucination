In other cases, I've run the doublespace installation without a problem when compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else. Seems to work for me.   Well, I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever that's worth.   Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression, I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin load before anything else.  With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.  Personally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those hooks and stuff.

With the directly attached fan units I've seen, it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be  a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words, if the fan stops the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to suffer permanent damage, not just stop working temporarily.  My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu, and it's located so the front fan, which sucks air into the case, blows right on the heat sink.  If that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise.  Essentially the  arrangement you're talking about and a good idea IMHO.

The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX socket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds. the 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor.  The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled, is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is",3,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480,yes

5243,"...  This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers, and users alike.  COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM port, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The first equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by the rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set of ""standard"" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for serial ports.  So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 COMM ports installed.

As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one of the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both. But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim ""low emissions"" but not specifically ""MPR-II Compliant"" or ""MPR-II Certified"" only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.

On my 386,  there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of  shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts  power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is  something like this on your board too.   In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on  ""Setup"" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to "" Always"" unless they know what password you used.
