Advances in freedom have been made in the past.  The ""divine right of king"" concept was questioned at one time and may have used the same argument, that it hadn't come about before.  But our ancestors had the courage to throw off the old system that said that one man ruling many was necessary to have a decent, wholesome society.  In the 1800s the  concept of slavery was questioned.  Our ancestors had the courage to question a practice that had existed for thousands of years.  Was the idea that one man owning another necessary to have a decent,  wholesome society?  Now libertarians question the necessity of majoritarianism.

There was quite a bit of meta-discussion during the trial over the use of graphic language, with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the exact language.  Practically every time the defense tried to get the plaintiffs to ""self-incriminate"" by asking them such questions, there were objections and sustains.   At one point the defense managed to get in a quip about ""solicitation for a felony"" and the judge herself said ""sustained"" before the prosecutor could get the objection stated.",18,talk.politics.misc,2023-10-14 18:59:16.722480,yes
